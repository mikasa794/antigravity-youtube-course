00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.376
[sighs]

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.339
You know what we should all do?

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:08.800
Go see a musical.

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:13.013
Sure.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.016
You know which one
we should see?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.562
The 1996 Tony Award winner.

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:24.399
Do you happen to know
the name of that one?

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.401
I don't know, um, "Grease?"

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:29.404
No.

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.575
"Rent?"

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:34.909
Yes! "Rent!"

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:37.746
Okay, so when do you want to go?

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.665
What? Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't, I'm busy.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.587
- Hey.
- 'Hey.'

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:49.257
Man, it is so hard
to shop for girls.

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:50.341
Oh!

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:52.969
Yes, it is, at Office Max!

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:56.806
What did you get her?

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.769
A pen.

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:04.647
It's two gifts in one.
It's a pen that's also a clock.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.066
Huh?

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:07.275
[laughs]

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:09.152
You can't give her that.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.029
- Why not?
- Because she's not 11!

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:14.824
And it's not the seventh night
of Chanukah!

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:20.163
Okay, honey,
what he means by that is..

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.998
Well, this is a very nice gift

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.793
maybe it's just not something
a boyfriend gives.

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.211
Sure it is.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:27.962
She needs a pen for work.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:29.714
She's writing,
she turns it over.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:32.050
Whoa! It's time
for my date with Joey!

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.471
Alright, look, look. What..

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.014
What did you get
for Angela Del Veccio

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:39.432
for her birthday?

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.518
She didn't have a birthday
while we were going out.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:42.936
For three years?

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.983
Look, it's too late,
and I got an audition.

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:51.861
I can't shop anymore. I..

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.780
Alright, I will go out

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.616
and I will try
to find something for her, okay?

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.243
Thanks, man.

00:01:58.243 --> 00:01:59.619
And oh, while you're at it

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.830
could you get her a card?

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:04.916
Would you like me to write her
a little poem as well?

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.294
Or just get a card
that has a poem already in it.
