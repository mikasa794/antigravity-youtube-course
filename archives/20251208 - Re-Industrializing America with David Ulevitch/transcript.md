[00:00:06] So, first of all, I'll thank uh everyone
[00:00:08] for coming. Welcome to South Park
[00:00:09] Commons, New York.
[00:00:14] And a huge thank you to David for doing
[00:00:17] this.
[00:00:21] Before we kick off uh what I know you're
[00:00:23] all here for, uh I have to do my duty
[00:00:26] and tell you a little bit about where
[00:00:27] you are and what South Park Commons is.
[00:00:30] Uh so there's a few of us on the South
[00:00:32] Park Commons New York team. Myself,
[00:00:35] Arian's over there. Jonathan and Susanna
[00:00:38] are hiding somewhere,
[00:00:40] but we opened this space just about two
[00:00:44] years ago. But South Park Commons has
[00:00:46] deep history in the Bay Area. started by
[00:00:49] two of the first engineers at Facebook
[00:00:52] who then went and sold a company to
[00:00:54] Dropbox and after helping scale those
[00:00:56] companies wanted to create a space for
[00:00:59] technologists to come together and
[00:01:00] explore the frontier. Uh at the time
[00:01:03] that was early researchers in ML,
[00:01:06] Ethereum, AI, but it's since expanded to
[00:01:09] a lot of other verticals. Um and we
[00:01:12] opened the space about two years ago to
[00:01:15] commune the New York community or the
[00:01:16] East Coast community to come do
[00:01:18] technical exploration as well. Our
[00:01:20] community is equity free. If you guys
[00:01:22] want to quit your job and have something
[00:01:24] to talk about to your parents and
[00:01:26] friends that you're not actually
[00:01:27] unemployed, that's what we're here for.
[00:01:29] We don't take any equity for it. Uh and
[00:01:31] then hopefully we get to be a partner
[00:01:32] for you as you build companies. Uh we
[00:01:35] really want to be at the forefront of
[00:01:37] where technology innovation is going
[00:01:38] which you know the reindustrialization
[00:01:41] of America or hard techch or deep tech
[00:01:44] is something that fits really closely
[00:01:46] within our remitt. So um please find us
[00:01:49] afterwards reach out. Without further
[00:01:51] ado I'll uh start the conversation.
[00:01:54] I'm going to read David's bio because I
[00:01:56] think even though you all know him I
[00:01:58] think it's incredibly worthwhile. So
[00:02:00] this is David Ulovich again. Thank you
[00:02:01] for coming.
[00:02:05] >> If you didn't know, he's a general
[00:02:07] partner at Andre Horowitz. Leads the
[00:02:09] American Dynamism practice and has been
[00:02:11] investing in companies advancing US
[00:02:13] interest in defense, national security,
[00:02:15] aerospace, and public safety. He's an
[00:02:18] investor in Anderole, CX-2, Flock
[00:02:20] Safety, Skyo, and others. But I think
[00:02:22] what's also really interesting is he
[00:02:24] started his career as a founder. He
[00:02:26] built Open DNS and sold it to Cisco.
[00:02:30] uh and you know he has all the degrees
[00:02:32] that everyone else has but I'm gonna I'm
[00:02:35] gonna move into the to the conversation
[00:02:37] now and we're going to start by telling
[00:02:40] us why American dynamism.
[00:02:44] >> Sure. So why American dynamism is a is a
[00:02:47] question with a ton of answers. But I
[00:02:50] think um if you think about
[00:02:54] like as an investor at least I I'll
[00:02:56] answer with the investor lens and then
[00:02:58] maybe the philosophical lens or the
[00:02:59] pragmatic lens later. But the why is
[00:03:02] that we're at a moment where we're in a
[00:03:05] tremendous technology transformation.
[00:03:07] Whether it's with AI that's driving
[00:03:09] autonomy, computer vision, we have an
[00:03:12] incredible base of talent in the startup
[00:03:15] community that's interested in these
[00:03:16] areas. Like the supply side exists in a
[00:03:19] way that never existed before. And on
[00:03:22] demand side, if you didn't already
[00:03:24] believe sort of in the national interest
[00:03:27] before COVID, CO sort of opened your
[00:03:29] eyes to supply chain risk. Um, I think
[00:03:31] increasing awareness of adversaries
[00:03:34] around the world where our um exquisite
[00:03:37] capabilities to defend America aren't as
[00:03:39] strong as people thought. Our supply
[00:03:42] chain that powers that capability is not
[00:03:44] as strong as people thought. and there
[00:03:46] and there's now an openness and a
[00:03:48] willingness and a readiness and a
[00:03:50] frankly a need on the demand side to
[00:03:52] have new technology um that both
[00:03:55] supports the US government that provides
[00:03:57] services that the US government is not
[00:03:59] providing that our allies are not
[00:04:01] providing. Um and so I I think if you
[00:04:03] just look at that intersection of both
[00:04:05] the supply and the demand, the demand is
[00:04:07] greater than it's ever been. And then
[00:04:08] also the capability on the supply side
[00:04:11] from both technology and talent is
[00:04:13] greater than it's ever been to actually
[00:04:14] meet meet that demand. Um that came
[00:04:17] together for us in the American Dynamism
[00:04:20] practice and now fund and soon soon to
[00:04:22] be second fund and and we just think
[00:04:25] that we want to provide the framework to
[00:04:27] let people build and then as well as to
[00:04:30] work with people in Washington to
[00:04:32] actually provide the conduits to
[00:04:34] actually connect companies to to
[00:04:35] government to be able to provide and
[00:04:36] facilitate all these things. And then
[00:04:38] once once we sort of focused on defense,
[00:04:40] it became very clear that there were a
[00:04:42] whole bunch of other things that sort of
[00:04:43] came downstream from that. Um
[00:04:46] manufacturing, the supply chain,
[00:04:47] industrial base, um public safety flew
[00:04:50] out of that. Energy flow flows out. Like
[00:04:52] you can't have a national security
[00:04:54] infrastructure without reliable energy.
[00:04:56] And if you start to look at our grid
[00:04:58] from power generation to power
[00:05:00] transportation to power storage, you
[00:05:02] start to realize that there are
[00:05:04] opportunities everywhere there to just
[00:05:06] dramatically advance this the state of
[00:05:09] the art in all those categories from you
[00:05:11] batteries, nuclear power, battery, you
[00:05:14] know, energy transmission, etc. So in
[00:05:16] each category that American dynamism has
[00:05:18] sort of expanded into it started mostly
[00:05:20] with defense but then it's bridged from
[00:05:22] there and the same supply and demand
[00:05:24] opportunity set sort of started to
[00:05:26] expose itself and I think that's why
[00:05:28] it's turned into a movement. Um, I hope
[00:05:30] that patriotism comes along with it and
[00:05:33] people are excited about having advanced
[00:05:35] software meet hardware and atoms, but
[00:05:37] uh, I think it's also just it's not an
[00:05:39] not only an opportunity to be patriotic
[00:05:41] and to do something where I think you're
[00:05:43] doing something really really good, but
[00:05:44] to also do really well doing it.
[00:05:47] >> Thanks for sharing that. Going back to
[00:05:49] when you started your first company, do
[00:05:52] you think it would have been possible to
[00:05:53] do something like this?
[00:05:55] >> Yeah, I mean I I I feel like first of
[00:05:56] all, I think American Dynamism is
[00:05:58] entrepreneurial. Um even though the
[00:06:00] product that we sell is um capital in
[00:06:03] exchange for equity we think of our
[00:06:04] business as we are in the business of
[00:06:06] creating products for entrepreneurs. So
[00:06:08] I still think of myself as an
[00:06:09] entrepreneur. The company I created was
[00:06:11] a cyber security company um OpenDNS. It
[00:06:14] was it was created at a time where um
[00:06:16] this this is going to sound so old but
[00:06:19] um where it was like a novel idea. The
[00:06:21] iPhone had just come out in 2007
[00:06:23] um and people were bringing devices to
[00:06:25] work. You couldn't just install endpoint
[00:06:27] cyber security software on devices as
[00:06:29] easily. Companies needed to secure their
[00:06:31] their corporate networks, their wireless
[00:06:33] infrastructure. There was this movement
[00:06:35] called BYOD, which is like kind of a
[00:06:37] stupid term now because everyone brings
[00:06:38] their own device to work, but it used to
[00:06:40] be that you used to have a company
[00:06:42] assigned, you know, Blackberry and you
[00:06:44] maybe were allowed to bring in your
[00:06:45] device. And so at that at that time it
[00:06:47] was it was useful to have a new kind of
[00:06:50] cyber security. Um would I have created
[00:06:52] a cyber security hardware company? pro
[00:06:55] probably not. Um I think that I knew
[00:06:58] nothing about hardware back then and I
[00:07:00] didn't work with people that knew about
[00:07:01] soft, you know, hardware and really
[00:07:03] Silicon Valley even though the origins
[00:07:05] and the roots came from defense and came
[00:07:07] from semiconductors and and hardware is
[00:07:10] is where venture capital and the modern
[00:07:12] day venture capital came from. It wasn't
[00:07:14] the venture capital I was exposed to. It
[00:07:15] wasn't the internet world I was exposed
[00:07:17] to, you know. And so when I I moved to
[00:07:19] the Bay Area in 2004,
[00:07:22] um after the sort of the dotcom bubble
[00:07:24] had burst and it was starting to to
[00:07:26] resurge, it was all software oriented.
[00:07:28] So I don't I don't think I would have I
[00:07:31] don't think the talent was there. I
[00:07:32] didn't know anything about it. My first
[00:07:34] exposure to hardware was when we got
[00:07:36] acquired by Cisco and and they they
[00:07:39] ultimately they gave me a billion dollar
[00:07:40] firewall business and we made our own
[00:07:43] hardware. We made our own chips and I
[00:07:44] knew I had to learn very quickly and
[00:07:46] that's when I learned about supply chain
[00:07:48] and semiconductors. I learned about you
[00:07:50] know a bomb cost for for hardware and
[00:07:52] all these things at at Cisco. That was
[00:07:54] really my first exposure. So I I don't
[00:07:55] think I would have started it and I
[00:07:57] don't think investors would have funded
[00:07:58] it.
[00:07:59] >> I want to get into this software
[00:08:01] hardware intersection right now but you
[00:08:03] mentioned being a founder and and
[00:08:05] American Dynamism essentially being
[00:08:07] something that has been founded like a
[00:08:09] company within a 16Z.
[00:08:11] you know, we're in an industry [snorts]
[00:08:12] of fast followers. There's lots of funds
[00:08:15] that have, you know, quickly followed
[00:08:17] suit. H how do you guys think about
[00:08:19] about that?
[00:08:20] >> Look, it's a it's a great time to be a
[00:08:22] founder building in the national
[00:08:23] interest. I It's amazing. I I watch
[00:08:25] other venture firms just bend over
[00:08:28] backwards to come up with all kinds of
[00:08:30] language to just not say the words
[00:08:31] American dynamism like all day long.
[00:08:34] It's like this is, you know,
[00:08:35] geopolitical global resilience. And I'm
[00:08:37] like, okay, well, you could just say
[00:08:38] American dynamism. Um but they don't and
[00:08:41] that's okay. Um so it's great it's great
[00:08:44] for the founders. I think for us you
[00:08:46] know look we can't invest in this whole
[00:08:47] category alone. It's you know v venture
[00:08:50] is a competitive business but it's more
[00:08:53] often than not a cooperative business.
[00:08:55] You're only competing in the round that
[00:08:57] you both want to invest in. And in fact
[00:08:59] in the hardware companies a lot of these
[00:09:00] rounds are often two-handed deals
[00:09:02] because you know frankly these companies
[00:09:04] are capital intensive. And it's a great
[00:09:07] thing for the entire category to now
[00:09:09] have both upstream investors that want
[00:09:11] to come in earlier than we do sometimes
[00:09:13] um and having downstream investors that
[00:09:15] want to follow on to our rounds. And so
[00:09:17] having more capital to go into companies
[00:09:20] is uh ultimately it's it's better for
[00:09:22] everybody. Um I think it certainly keeps
[00:09:25] us competitive and thinking about how do
[00:09:27] we offer again differentiated products
[00:09:29] to the market. Um, you know, for us over
[00:09:32] the last 18 months, we've really focused
[00:09:34] on what what does it mean to be the
[00:09:36] venture firm that wants to support
[00:09:38] entrepreneurs at every stage of their of
[00:09:40] their journey. And one of those things
[00:09:41] that we think in American dynamism is
[00:09:43] really can be transformative is helping
[00:09:45] founders on the regulatory and policy
[00:09:47] front. So, we have a big DC office. Um,
[00:09:50] we have a policy team. We have a
[00:09:52] government affairs team. Um, the
[00:09:54] communications leader for American
[00:09:55] Dynamis is based in DC and is steeped in
[00:09:58] DC DNA. She's actually Hopefully I
[00:10:00] didn't offend her when I said that. Um I
[00:10:02] don't think everything in DC is bad. Um
[00:10:05] and we will help companies. So like
[00:10:06] right now we're trying to push a lot of
[00:10:08] defense procurement reform so that the
[00:10:10] government buyers whether you're a
[00:10:12] program officer or an acquisitions
[00:10:14] officer in the department of war. You
[00:10:16] don't get in trouble for picking a
[00:10:17] startup. You don't get in trouble for
[00:10:18] picking a commercial solution instead of
[00:10:20] a bespoke, you know, prime solution. Um
[00:10:23] so that you can actually say I want to
[00:10:26] focus on uh capabilities and not buying
[00:10:29] a specific skew from a specific vendor.
[00:10:32] So, we're advancing all these uh reforms
[00:10:35] and we're doing that on behalf of our
[00:10:36] companies, but also that'll it'll
[00:10:37] benefit every company. Um, but we're
[00:10:39] trying to help our companies in these
[00:10:40] areas and I think all these things
[00:10:42] ultimately are good for founders. It
[00:10:44] keeps us competitive. You know, if you
[00:10:46] if you're a founder, you know that it's
[00:10:48] not like your competition is not the
[00:10:50] thing that kills you. Comp. The number
[00:10:52] one thing that kills companies is
[00:10:53] running out of money. Like that's number
[00:10:54] one. Number two is just like not moving
[00:10:56] fast enough. It's not particularly your
[00:10:58] competition. You need to hire the best
[00:10:59] people, have the mo, you know, never run
[00:11:01] out of money, be able to magnetically
[00:11:02] attract capital, attract people, and
[00:11:04] then go serve your customer. Competition
[00:11:06] almost never factors into it. So, the
[00:11:08] same is true with us on the venture
[00:11:09] side.
[00:11:11] >> You talk about selling into government?
[00:11:13] Something I wanted to ask you about is,
[00:11:16] is the government buyer a rational
[00:11:18] actor? Are they driven by profits and
[00:11:20] driven by the best products or are there
[00:11:23] other things that founders need to do to
[00:11:24] actually win here?
[00:11:26] Um the government is like the most
[00:11:29] complicated enterprise sales process
[00:11:31] you've ever been in where there's
[00:11:33] multiple stakeholders. You first of all
[00:11:34] and then the funding process for the
[00:11:36] government is unlike any customer where
[00:11:39] oftentimes Congress needs to appropriate
[00:11:41] money for what you're interested in and
[00:11:43] then it needs to actually be acquired
[00:11:45] and decided upon and there's complex
[00:11:47] RFPs often and you know sometimes
[00:11:50] they'll ask you well what have you sold
[00:11:52] to the government in the past. So past
[00:11:53] performance is often a criteria for
[00:11:55] selling to the government now, which is
[00:11:56] very hard for a startup that's never
[00:11:57] sold anything to the government. So when
[00:11:59] they when they tell you that part of
[00:12:00] their evaluation criteria is past
[00:12:02] performance, well, like that kind of
[00:12:03] sucks unless you're a legacy incumbent.
[00:12:05] And you know, that's another example of
[00:12:07] a reform that we're trying to get rid
[00:12:09] of, you know, that we're trying to
[00:12:10] change. Um, but selling to the
[00:12:13] government, I would say it is like
[00:12:15] enterprise sales in that there are
[00:12:17] multiple stakeholders. You have to
[00:12:19] figure out who holds the budget. Who are
[00:12:21] the decision makers? But at a certain
[00:12:23] point, just like any really large like
[00:12:25] seven figure or eight figure, eight
[00:12:27] figure enterprise sales deal. At some
[00:12:29] point, your customer is so invested in
[00:12:31] your success that you end up not being
[00:12:33] on the other side of the table from
[00:12:34] them. They end up they're like in some
[00:12:36] ways the government customer. It's not
[00:12:37] some big monolith. It's like some some
[00:12:39] person, you know, this man or woman is
[00:12:41] like betting their career on picking
[00:12:43] your solution and you're really arming
[00:12:46] them for meetings. You're giving making
[00:12:47] sure they have all the material they
[00:12:48] need. You're filling out endless reams
[00:12:51] of paperwork. You're submitting yourself
[00:12:53] to audits and accounting things that you
[00:12:55] should never submit yourself to. The
[00:12:56] same you would do if you wanted to go
[00:12:58] sell to Johnson and Johnson or to
[00:13:00] Goldman Sachs. Like, you know, if you
[00:13:01] want to go sell a million- dollar deal
[00:13:03] to Goldman Sachs, you're going to go
[00:13:04] through all kinds of, you know,
[00:13:05] forensics and and financial forensics
[00:13:07] and all kinds of things. They might ask
[00:13:09] for your source code, all these things.
[00:13:10] And the government is not entirely
[00:13:12] different. It is laborious. It is
[00:13:14] lengthy. We know as investors that the
[00:13:17] the curve to revenue generation can be
[00:13:19] very drawn out to do these things. And
[00:13:22] so we evaluate companies on other
[00:13:23] milestones and other measure measures of
[00:13:25] progress. It's not like a SAS company
[00:13:27] where you get to like, you know, a
[00:13:28] million bucks and then maybe you get to
[00:13:29] four million bucks and then maybe you
[00:13:30] get to 10 million. It's not like that.
[00:13:32] You know, it might be like 0000
[00:13:34] million, right? And then you're like,
[00:13:35] oh, amazing. Then we got to $100
[00:13:36] million. But it was like zeros for a
[00:13:38] long time. So we know that in the sales
[00:13:40] process is hard. Um, but I I think it's
[00:13:43] the closest large complicated enterprise
[00:13:47] sales.
[00:13:48] >> Historically investors would have shied
[00:13:50] away from this. What do you think the
[00:13:51] tipping point has been and now it's
[00:13:54] actually something that people are
[00:13:55] really comfortable with? the the
[00:13:56] previous hurdles that people used to
[00:13:58] call these things like the valley of
[00:14:00] death when you were when you were
[00:14:01] building software for the government
[00:14:02] especially and I'm talking about the
[00:14:04] federal government in particular and and
[00:14:06] and even the the Pentagon and the
[00:14:07] intelligence community mostly where it'd
[00:14:10] be easy to get like a research contract
[00:14:11] like these civers that give you you know
[00:14:14] 500 grand a million bucks 2 million
[00:14:15] bucks but you can never sort of jump
[00:14:17] over to getting these major programs um
[00:14:20] but the government has created in the
[00:14:22] last few years and and some of these
[00:14:24] aren't so new programs they start using
[00:14:26] them more. The ability to actually get
[00:14:28] um other form things like OTAAS where
[00:14:31] you can actually get outside the
[00:14:33] contracting process and outside of
[00:14:35] traditional contracting vehicles to get
[00:14:37] real dollars coming in $20 million, $50
[00:14:39] million, $100 million contracts. And
[00:14:41] OTAA, I think, can go up to $500
[00:14:43] million. And where the customers now
[00:14:45] recognize a need for new technology,
[00:14:47] their superiors support them and give
[00:14:49] them air cover in procuring new
[00:14:51] technology. You have branches of the
[00:14:53] Department of War that are specifically
[00:14:55] focused on testing out new capabilities
[00:14:57] like the Special Operations Command,
[00:15:00] like Transcom, like the folks in
[00:15:01] Indopaccom. They have specific groups
[00:15:03] within these organizations that are
[00:15:05] really excited to try something out and
[00:15:06] if it works, they will embrace it.
[00:15:08] They'll buy it quickly. Some of the
[00:15:10] budget authorities been pushed down. So
[00:15:11] all these changes have made us much more
[00:15:13] bullish on supporting defense companies.
[00:15:16] But then we also know that like you know
[00:15:18] whether you're an Anderoll or another
[00:15:20] company um you know, a Castellian,
[00:15:22] whoever, you need other things. You need
[00:15:24] rocket motors, you need rare earth
[00:15:26] magnets, you need reliable energy. And
[00:15:28] so, there's lots of other areas we
[00:15:29] invest in where they're not entirely
[00:15:31] dependent on the Department of War to be
[00:15:33] their sole customer. Um, so, and then I
[00:15:35] guess the last thing I would say on that
[00:15:36] is that the American Dynamism companies,
[00:15:39] like I I always like to remind people,
[00:15:41] it's not just about selling to America,
[00:15:43] the Department of War, it just like the
[00:15:45] American dream, like American Dynamism
[00:15:47] goes way beyond our borders. And so a
[00:15:48] lot of America's allies really look to
[00:15:51] what does the United States buy for its
[00:15:53] military and to protect the men and
[00:15:55] women who serve. And so very quickly
[00:15:57] things will translate to the UK Royal
[00:15:58] Marines and to other other governments
[00:16:00] all around the world. And so that you
[00:16:02] know the opportunities in the markets
[00:16:03] that we think we're selling into just
[00:16:05] continue to get bigger and bigger. Um
[00:16:07] you know the world is not getting any
[00:16:09] less spicy. So you know un unfortunately
[00:16:11] like the tailwinds and and uh
[00:16:14] transforming technology for for the
[00:16:16] government is I think you know going to
[00:16:18] continue to grow. You know American
[00:16:21] dynamism is you know encompasses
[00:16:24] healthcare energy lots of different
[00:16:26] aspects of uh you know the
[00:16:28] re-industrialization of America.
[00:16:30] Historically VCs have always looked for
[00:16:32] public market comps when underwriting
[00:16:34] companies. Would are we looking at new
[00:16:37] category creation here or or are there
[00:16:40] existing ones?
[00:16:41] >> Look, aerospace and defense is an
[00:16:43] established category. I think if you
[00:16:44] were a public market investor in the
[00:16:46] aerospace and defense category over the
[00:16:48] last two years, you'd be very happy with
[00:16:50] yourself. I think if you were investing
[00:16:51] in energy as like the AI boom has taken
[00:16:54] off and we have this just insatiable
[00:16:56] insatiable thirst for energy, you'd be
[00:16:58] very happy. You know, granted we're like
[00:17:00] in a bull market. So all these
[00:17:01] categories are are up, but in in
[00:17:03] particular energy, aerospace and
[00:17:05] defense, rare earth minerals, all these
[00:17:07] things. I mean, even companies that, you
[00:17:09] know, are kind of like borderline meme
[00:17:10] stocks or like that that even talk about
[00:17:12] nuclear or energy are way up. And so I
[00:17:16] don't think these categories are new. I
[00:17:17] think that the markets that a lot of
[00:17:19] these categories are are are, you know,
[00:17:23] the occupy are continuing to grow. in
[00:17:26] fact are going to grow at faster rates
[00:17:27] than we expect. And I don't think that I
[00:17:30] mean you can look at at any existing
[00:17:31] category where technology has been
[00:17:32] disruptive. I don't think the incumbents
[00:17:34] are going to capitalize on the
[00:17:36] opportunity. You can you can kind of
[00:17:37] laugh about like well what is AI going
[00:17:39] to do to transform mining? But the
[00:17:41] answer is actually it may be a lot. It
[00:17:42] may it may do a lot to transform mining.
[00:17:44] And it's very unlikely that a company
[00:17:46] like Rio Tinto that is just just
[00:17:48] throwing off profits at a crazy degree
[00:17:51] that has never been a software company
[00:17:52] is really going to capitalize on that.
[00:17:54] And over time the tables change and
[00:17:56] there may be an opportunity where a new
[00:17:59] mining company that is really software
[00:18:01] driven in their site selection in their
[00:18:03] process for extracting minerals for
[00:18:05] refining those minerals and getting them
[00:18:06] under the open market may actually be a
[00:18:08] transformative opportunity. Um or that
[00:18:11] might be four companies not just one
[00:18:13] company right so um there are categories
[00:18:16] there. I think there's public comps and
[00:18:17] I think we're going to see that the
[00:18:19] markets that these public comps even are
[00:18:21] in are even larger than we think.
[00:18:25] in these categories. I mean there was
[00:18:27] there are people who worked in AI for
[00:18:28] like 30 years but nobody would have told
[00:18:30] you what the market was for like an AI
[00:18:32] company like open AAI like if you had
[00:18:34] asked 10 years ago how big can the AI
[00:18:36] market for a dedicated like how big can
[00:18:38] deep buying be well like nobody thought
[00:18:40] that big until Google bought them right
[00:18:41] but like now nobody would would think
[00:18:43] that
[00:18:45] >> in these categories where are people
[00:18:48] coming from like what actually makes a
[00:18:49] great founder in one of these verticals
[00:18:52] >> I think you know this goes to the supply
[00:18:54] side comment that I made earl earlier,
[00:18:56] you know, here in New York, I think
[00:18:58] Palanteer's largest engineering office
[00:19:00] is here in New York. Um, you have
[00:19:02] companies like SpaceX that has like
[00:19:04] 17,000 people and, you know, there are
[00:19:07] people leaving SpaceX that now have
[00:19:09] tremendous exposure to software, to
[00:19:11] hardware, and a way of company building
[00:19:13] and moving with a speed of urgency that
[00:19:15] they have seen what that success looks
[00:19:17] like. They can feel it, they can taste
[00:19:19] it, and they want to go replicate that
[00:19:20] with their own business. A lot of
[00:19:22] companies that come out of SpaceX are
[00:19:24] people that had a problem SpaceX kind of
[00:19:26] fixed it just for SpaceX, but then
[00:19:28] realized, wait, I can fix this for
[00:19:29] entire categories of the market. Um, and
[00:19:33] so there's tons of founders coming out
[00:19:34] of those companies. And then even, you
[00:19:37] know, like we were talking about this a
[00:19:38] little bit earlier when we were just
[00:19:39] chatting, you know, people can sort of
[00:19:41] talk about like the Gundo um as a PL and
[00:19:43] that's like outside Los Angeles if if
[00:19:45] you haven't heard of it. Um, but just
[00:19:47] like we have the Brooklyn Navyyard here,
[00:19:49] you get these sort of pockets of
[00:19:51] excellence where founders congregate and
[00:19:53] gravitate and you get the alumni of
[00:19:56] SNAP, of SpaceX, of the National Labs,
[00:19:59] of JPL and you know, founders start to
[00:20:02] move there and then more founders move
[00:20:03] there and you just start to become you
[00:20:05] get an ecosystem. Um, I think we have
[00:20:07] that here in New York. I think we have
[00:20:08] it in LA both for American Dynamism in
[00:20:11] specific. Um, of course we have some of
[00:20:13] it in the Bay Area. Um, we have some of
[00:20:15] it in Austin. And those founders,
[00:20:17] they've seen what success looks like.
[00:20:19] They've seen what hardware companies
[00:20:21] that are successful look like um and how
[00:20:23] to use commodity hardware in particular
[00:20:25] um to great advantage. And they've seen
[00:20:27] what great software looks like when
[00:20:28] paired with it. And uh and I think, you
[00:20:31] know, I guess maybe the last to mention
[00:20:33] is the founders are very
[00:20:34] missionoriented. You have to be
[00:20:35] missionoriented. It's a it's not an
[00:20:37] overnight success. It's a long road to
[00:20:39] revenue. It's a long road to product. If
[00:20:41] you want to build a missile company,
[00:20:42] you're not going to be like blowing
[00:20:44] things up the first day. like it's just
[00:20:45] not it's not going to happen that way.
[00:20:47] You know, you got to do launches, you
[00:20:48] got to build rocket motors, you got to
[00:20:50] start fabricating things, you got to get
[00:20:51] kinetics, you got to figure out how to
[00:20:53] get your kinetics, you got to figure out
[00:20:54] how to put them on there without blowing
[00:20:55] your hands off. Um, and so like, you
[00:20:58] know, it's a long journey. You got to be
[00:21:00] fired up about that mission and say,
[00:21:02] "Wait a minute, you know, we we had a
[00:21:05] 10-year stockpile of Stinger missiles
[00:21:06] that we used in the Ukraine in three
[00:21:08] months." Like that that didn't work out.
[00:21:10] So, we need to have a new way to procure
[00:21:12] Stinger missiles. And By the way, our
[00:21:14] Stinger missiles primarily come from
[00:21:16] South Korea. If we're in a conflict with
[00:21:18] China, I promise you South Korea is not
[00:21:20] going to send us all those Stinger
[00:21:21] missiles. Like, just not going to
[00:21:22] happen. Then we will have none. And so,
[00:21:24] like, if you're excited about that, you
[00:21:26] got to be mission driven and say like,
[00:21:27] "This is the problem I'm going to solve
[00:21:29] and and get and get fired up about it."
[00:21:32] >> Do you think that businesses to be at
[00:21:35] scale in this category have to be
[00:21:37] hardware?
[00:21:38] >> No, for sure. We have we have a company
[00:21:40] called Airspace Intelligence that is
[00:21:42] transforming flight operations and using
[00:21:44] that base of all the airlines that they
[00:21:46] now support and serve. We're going to go
[00:21:47] after a billion and a half dollar FAA
[00:21:49] contract. That's a soft software only
[00:21:51] company that's bringing advanced AI and
[00:21:53] and machine learning capabilities to
[00:21:56] something that is just such an obvious
[00:21:57] problem to solve that, you know, it's
[00:21:59] almost like dumbfounding that we haven't
[00:22:01] solved it yet. Um but like they're going
[00:22:02] to they're going to go you know the FAA
[00:22:04] just put out a billion and a half dollar
[00:22:05] contract to transform um contracting and
[00:22:08] I'm sure you know airspace intelligence
[00:22:10] go after it software only. We have we
[00:22:12] have a bunch of other companies that
[00:22:14] support the American Dynamis and mission
[00:22:16] that are software only. Even at the
[00:22:17] state and local level company like
[00:22:19] Kaizen makes it easier to go reserve a
[00:22:22] tennis court at a park using software
[00:22:24] that feels like it was written in the
[00:22:26] modern era and not written in 19 you
[00:22:28] know 92.
[00:22:30] And on the the hardware side of things,
[00:22:32] obviously there's a lot of talk about
[00:22:33] robotics and automation. Amazon said
[00:22:35] they're going to, you know, automate all
[00:22:36] their warehouse work. What is the
[00:22:39] American Dynamism thesis on robotics and
[00:22:42] humanoids?
[00:22:44] >> So, we have people on on our team um
[00:22:46] Oliver [clears throat] Sue and and Aaron
[00:22:48] Price, right, who are much more expert
[00:22:50] in robotics than I am. So, my answer is
[00:22:52] I would say just my answer. It's not a
[00:22:53] team answer. My answer is that I think
[00:22:56] it's going to be incredibly difficult
[00:22:59] for us to compete with China on the
[00:23:02] commodity robotics components. I think
[00:23:05] it's a national imperative that we build
[00:23:07] motors and actuators here in the US. But
[00:23:09] when it comes to just like a a humanoid
[00:23:11] cheap robot, um it's kind of like the
[00:23:14] way we see the drone market playing out
[00:23:15] like you cannot be cost competitive with
[00:23:17] DJI here. It's just very hard. You can
[00:23:19] make a better drone here with better
[00:23:20] software and you can make it at a higher
[00:23:22] price point that is for a specific
[00:23:25] mission, but if you just want to make
[00:23:26] like a cheap drone that's just like a
[00:23:28] consumer mass drone, like you can't you
[00:23:29] cannot make it cheaper than China can
[00:23:30] make it. And there's a bunch of
[00:23:32] structural reasons for that. And it's
[00:23:33] going to be the same in robotics. Where
[00:23:35] I think we can win is where we run our
[00:23:37] software on those on those cheap robots.
[00:23:40] So I think it's there's going to be lots
[00:23:41] of great robotic software here in the
[00:23:43] US. Lots of vertical companies in the
[00:23:46] robotic space that are like full full
[00:23:48] service where they deliver the robot,
[00:23:49] they provide the service, they provide
[00:23:51] the teleoperation when there's a failure
[00:23:53] and you need operation. They're going to
[00:23:54] provide all the machine learning around
[00:23:56] the the sort of real world models that
[00:23:59] need to be used for these robotics.
[00:24:01] There's going to be data collection
[00:24:03] companies that are built. I think it's
[00:24:05] going to be hard to like like I'm
[00:24:06] personally, this is just a personal
[00:24:08] view. I think there's other people in my
[00:24:09] firm that disagree. I think to compete
[00:24:12] an Americanmade humanoid robot will be
[00:24:15] very difficult to be cost competitive
[00:24:16] for the mass market. not for specialized
[00:24:19] use cases, but for the mass market.
[00:24:21] China is so far ahead and I think it's
[00:24:23] okay. I don't think we have to compete
[00:24:26] particularly to win. Like that's just
[00:24:27] not like a fight we have to go win. Um
[00:24:30] it's the same way that you know you
[00:24:32] might read articles about how China can
[00:24:33] produce 400 ships a year. Um naval ships
[00:24:36] like big big ships like oh god like how
[00:24:39] come we can't produce 400 naval ships a
[00:24:41] year? Like we're going to get toasted in
[00:24:42] a in a conflict. Like we don't need to
[00:24:44] make 400 ships a year. We need 400
[00:24:46] missiles that can't be intercepted that
[00:24:48] can just blow up those 400 chips. Like
[00:24:49] we don't we don't need to make 400 chips
[00:24:51] a year. That's not the fight in the
[00:24:52] game. We have to win. So I think the
[00:24:54] opportunity with robotics will be
[00:24:55] software. It won't be the commodity
[00:24:57] hardware market.
[00:24:59] >> So do you think that just to reiterate
[00:25:01] it's the things that are where some of
[00:25:04] the countries around the world have very
[00:25:05] low labor cost are better opportunity is
[00:25:09] to focus on quality versus trying to
[00:25:11] reshore lowcost automation of labor. I
[00:25:14] would love for an entrepreneur to tell
[00:25:15] me why we can build humanoid robots here
[00:25:17] at a lower cost than China. Like it'd be
[00:25:18] great if that happens. Like you you
[00:25:20] don't have to do it in like the Q&A
[00:25:21] session. Just email me later. Um I don't
[00:25:24] need my competitors to hear, but but
[00:25:26] like it would be great. I I'm skeptical
[00:25:28] that will be the case. And like I said,
[00:25:29] I think it's okay. Um I certainly think
[00:25:32] that we have to all these things we have
[00:25:34] to do to secure our national interest
[00:25:36] and pro includes our neighbors. You have
[00:25:38] to use some of our allied neighbors. I
[00:25:41] think it is more challenging to rely on
[00:25:44] people that are across an ocean because
[00:25:46] I think in a real conflict the logistics
[00:25:48] of moving important ingredients and raw
[00:25:50] materials and things that are in the
[00:25:52] supply chain that are critical for us
[00:25:54] across an ocean becomes more
[00:25:55] challenging. Um but Mexico and Canada
[00:25:57] for sure, South America for sure. I
[00:25:59] think Europe has a huge opportunity
[00:26:01] around manufacturing um and around
[00:26:03] chemicals that you know that they used
[00:26:05] to be leaders in chemical production.
[00:26:07] They're not anymore. Um, but they
[00:26:09] certainly could be.
[00:26:10] >> We have a company that I'll introduce
[00:26:12] you to who who will try to convince.
[00:26:13] >> A chemical company or a humanoid
[00:26:14] company?
[00:26:15] >> A humanoid company.
[00:26:16] >> Okay. I'm all for it. It's it looks I'm
[00:26:18] wrong about things all the time. That's
[00:26:20] my my current view of the Chinese
[00:26:21] robotics market is they're way ahead.
[00:26:23] But like if you think we're going to
[00:26:24] beat them, let's go.
[00:26:26] >> Uh you mentioned the Gundo and and if
[00:26:28] and when Aditi decide to open SPC Gundo,
[00:26:32] I will move there. But until then, uh
[00:26:35] I'm in New York. What are the categories
[00:26:37] that you think New York is uniquely
[00:26:39] positioned to attract the best talent
[00:26:41] for?
[00:26:43] >> So I think well I think New York can be
[00:26:45] because there's a talent base here that
[00:26:47] comes out of Palunteer. I think because
[00:26:48] of our proximity um to Washington DC to
[00:26:53] Northfor Virginia to Annapolis to West
[00:26:56] Point you have just incredible talent
[00:26:58] bases information and and not just
[00:27:00] talent but like even just through
[00:27:02] osmosis you remember like people always
[00:27:04] forget this like West Point's like an
[00:27:05] hour north of here it's just like not
[00:27:07] not far it's beautiful you can go up
[00:27:09] there you can meet people you can give
[00:27:10] if you're a founder you can talk about
[00:27:11] they have a whole entrepreneurship
[00:27:13] program there I'm sure they'd love to
[00:27:14] meet other founders um and we have you
[00:27:17] know, massive amounts of our Navy and
[00:27:19] ship building and repair business in
[00:27:21] Norfolk and we have DC here. And so I
[00:27:23] think that if you're building and
[00:27:24] defense, it's a great place to be. We
[00:27:26] have a naval the Brooklyn um navyard,
[00:27:29] shipyard, whatever they call it. Um
[00:27:30] where they let you fly drones, they let
[00:27:32] you do beyond visual line of sight drone
[00:27:34] flights there. Um there's all kind it's
[00:27:36] kind of like a special zone that they've
[00:27:37] created to let people do a bunch of
[00:27:38] advanced testing around drones. Um I
[00:27:41] think there's tons of amazing software
[00:27:43] engineers. There's people that have
[00:27:44] made, you know, like they made some
[00:27:45] money pounder or two sigma or chain
[00:27:48] street or whatever and they actually
[00:27:49] want to spend their time doing something
[00:27:50] else um and building the national
[00:27:52] interest. So I think there's a great
[00:27:53] talent base here. Um I think you have a
[00:27:56] proximity to Europe. It's just much
[00:27:58] easier to get around. So look, you know,
[00:28:00] I think New York is for sure a key area.
[00:28:03] There's also if you're it's not my area,
[00:28:05] but if you're interested in medical
[00:28:06] devices like Striker is based in New
[00:28:08] Jersey. It's one of the leading medical
[00:28:09] device companies that makes hardware and
[00:28:11] software for for the healthcare space.
[00:28:14] Um, ton tons of opportunity.
[00:28:17] >> There's a quick uh question here. How
[00:28:19] many people are from Palanteer in the
[00:28:20] audience
[00:28:21] >> or worked at Palanteer in the past?
[00:28:24] Four or five
[00:28:26] or they're not telling us.
[00:28:29] >> We're not filming this side of the room,
[00:28:30] don't worry. Uh, and of the companies
[00:28:33] that you have invested in, what have you
[00:28:35] seen that has made them exceptional
[00:28:38] that's different from the traditional
[00:28:39] Silicon Valley tech company?
[00:28:45] I think that the um
[00:28:48] a lot of the founders in American
[00:28:49] Dynamism like in this room it feels like
[00:28:53] in vogue maybe to be building in this
[00:28:55] area. It feels cool. It's something
[00:28:57] you're interested in. You're passionate
[00:28:58] about it. Even if it doesn't feel cool,
[00:28:59] you're you're personally passionate
[00:29:01] about it. There's still lots of stigma
[00:29:03] around this. Like I I think of a company
[00:29:05] like Flock Safety that I invested in and
[00:29:08] you know in 2021 when I invested in
[00:29:09] Flock Safety, this was like the height
[00:29:12] of the Black Lives Matter movement, the
[00:29:13] Defund the Police Movement. But like the
[00:29:15] founder there was just so cleareyed
[00:29:18] about making policing more objective
[00:29:20] about stopping crimes, about making
[00:29:22] communities safer. And as we did
[00:29:24] diligence and called into these
[00:29:25] communities, we we actually found that
[00:29:27] like the more marginalized the
[00:29:28] community, they more they liked flock
[00:29:30] safety because they wanted police to be
[00:29:31] trusted to be more objective and and but
[00:29:34] the founder had to be super cleareyed
[00:29:35] about what the mission was, why it was
[00:29:37] good. Um, and you need that for a bunch
[00:29:39] of reasons. One is you need that to be
[00:29:40] able to attract talent. Great talent
[00:29:41] wants to believe in the in the mission
[00:29:43] that the founder um projects and you
[00:29:47] also need it because you're going to get
[00:29:48] hit pieces more often than like a normal
[00:29:51] like enterprise SAS company is not going
[00:29:52] to get in the press, but you will get
[00:29:55] them when you're working in public
[00:29:56] safety, whe even 911. I mean, we have a
[00:29:58] 911 company that would have that would
[00:30:00] occasionally get get issues. Um, and so
[00:30:03] when you're building these kinds of
[00:30:04] companies, you just you need to it's
[00:30:06] like it's it's too easy to say you have
[00:30:08] to have thick skin. It's really that you
[00:30:10] have to have deep conviction in what
[00:30:11] you're doing to know that people are
[00:30:13] going to misrepresent what you do.
[00:30:15] Obviously, this happens to companies
[00:30:16] like Anderrol and others all the time.
[00:30:17] It happens to Palunteer all the time. Um
[00:30:20] and and you just have to be really
[00:30:22] cleareyed about and and mission oriented
[00:30:24] around it so that you can attract
[00:30:26] talent, you can attract capital. Um stay
[00:30:28] focused on the mission, not react to uh
[00:30:31] the press. And then I think you have to
[00:30:33] be flexible. I would say, you know, my
[00:30:36] my experience watching these companies
[00:30:39] is you kind of get punched in the face a
[00:30:41] little bit more often than you probably
[00:30:43] should. You know, the government's shut
[00:30:45] down right now. like people that were
[00:30:46] expecting to get um money in before the
[00:30:49] fiscal year closed at the end of
[00:30:50] September. Like that may not happen now
[00:30:52] because the government has shut down.
[00:30:54] Like you just have to deal with that. If
[00:30:56] you kept sending out investor updates
[00:30:57] and telling your employees that we're
[00:30:58] going to close a $25 million deal before
[00:31:00] the end of the government fiscal year
[00:31:01] like I don't know, may not happen. Is
[00:31:03] that going to affect your ability to
[00:31:04] raise money? Like you you have to
[00:31:06] navigate that. And so I think there is a
[00:31:08] level of of fortitude that goes along
[00:31:10] with it. Um and just flexibility and
[00:31:13] being able to react to things. And then
[00:31:15] I guess maybe the last thing I would say
[00:31:16] is the level of financial sophistication
[00:31:19] of these founders especially in these
[00:31:21] hardware companies is just much much
[00:31:23] stronger and you have to get much more
[00:31:25] financially savvy much more quickly.
[00:31:27] Like if you're building a nuclear
[00:31:29] reactor like radiant nuclear is it's
[00:31:32] this is not like the agile methodology.
[00:31:34] This is like waterfall to the nth degree
[00:31:37] where you are thinking out you know 36
[00:31:40] months from now and even beyond that
[00:31:42] when you have to pull back the nuclear
[00:31:44] waste on site and store it for the next
[00:31:46] 50 years like this is not just like our
[00:31:48] we're doing a daily standup of like what
[00:31:50] are we working on today? Um and so and
[00:31:52] then and that applies not just to your
[00:31:54] product roadmap but to your financial
[00:31:56] roadmap. Exactly. And you know these are
[00:31:57] companies that are going to incinerate
[00:31:59] hundreds of millions of dollars of cash
[00:32:01] on the way to get to their outcome. Um,
[00:32:04] and so the financial sophistication of
[00:32:06] the founders, you cannot just outsource
[00:32:08] it to like a bookkeeper. Um, it doesn't
[00:32:11] mean you have to hire a CFO so early,
[00:32:13] but it mean but you are the CFO until
[00:32:15] you have a CFO. And even when you have a
[00:32:17] CFO, you need to know what's going on in
[00:32:19] the business. And you need to know that
[00:32:20] you're not going to run out of money.
[00:32:21] And again, it's such an easy joke to
[00:32:23] make. The number one reason companies
[00:32:24] fail is to run out of money. But like
[00:32:26] that is the number one reason companies
[00:32:27] fail. And you do not want that to be
[00:32:29] your reason why you you do or do not
[00:32:30] succeed. Are the non-equity capital
[00:32:33] markets sophisticated enough here? Like
[00:32:36] are there other products that you're
[00:32:37] seeing founders use?
[00:32:38] >> Yeah, there's there's project financing.
[00:32:40] There's things like that, but those
[00:32:41] don't happen to your to your um m much
[00:32:44] much further along. You you need to have
[00:32:48] stable revenue. You need to have
[00:32:50] customer commitments. Like look, if
[00:32:52] you're building nuclear if you're
[00:32:53] building a factory for nuclear reactors
[00:32:55] and you have an order for 100 reactors,
[00:32:57] yes, you can go get project financing
[00:32:59] for that for sure. But if you're not
[00:33:00] there and you need $100 million to go
[00:33:02] build a factory, like you better go
[00:33:04] raise that $und00 million and then
[00:33:05] figure out how to not spend it on nap
[00:33:07] pods and free lunches, right? And what
[00:33:10] do you think about these harder tech
[00:33:11] teams that go and get these contracts,
[00:33:14] LOIs,
[00:33:16] but they're contingent on so many
[00:33:18] technical milestones that might be six,
[00:33:20] 12, 18 months away at the bare minimum.
[00:33:23] >> I'm I'm again, this is more of a
[00:33:25] personal view. I don't really support
[00:33:26] the LOI thing. People bring them to me
[00:33:28] all the time. Um, it doesn't count for
[00:33:31] anything. They're always ways for
[00:33:33] customers to walk away from them. The
[00:33:35] people that care put skin in the game.
[00:33:36] You can always raise money from your
[00:33:37] customers. If you're really doing
[00:33:39] something big where like the customer is
[00:33:40] going to spend 30 or $300 million with
[00:33:43] you, have your customer invest. Uh, you
[00:33:45] know, assuming your customer is not not
[00:33:46] the government. Have your customer
[00:33:48] invest. If your customer is the
[00:33:49] government and they're going to buy $300
[00:33:51] million of something from you, they will
[00:33:52] give you $30 million as an R&D grant.
[00:33:55] You can go apply for a cyber. you can
[00:33:57] you can get a server phase one, phase
[00:33:58] two, and by the time you get to a phase
[00:34:00] three, you can get real money to drive
[00:34:02] that that production capability. So I
[00:34:05] and there's all kinds of ways that we
[00:34:06] try to help companies understand this.
[00:34:08] Um but I think that you got to collect
[00:34:10] the money from your and then there is
[00:34:12] project financing later on but I would
[00:34:14] say earlier in the journey you have to
[00:34:17] find ways to bring in either customer
[00:34:18] revenue or you have to be really good at
[00:34:20] raising money like magnetically the the
[00:34:22] two things that matter most for a
[00:34:24] founder are magnetically attracting
[00:34:25] talent and magnetically attracting
[00:34:27] capital and if you cannot do those two
[00:34:29] things you will not be successful. If
[00:34:31] you can do those two things, you can
[00:34:32] kind of overcome almost every hurdle
[00:34:34] that comes your way.
[00:34:37] >> In terms of taking money from from the
[00:34:39] government, I mean, there are countries
[00:34:41] or sovereign wealth funds that do invest
[00:34:43] either directly or or into other funds.
[00:34:46] How sensitive or how concerned do
[00:34:47] founders have to be about where the
[00:34:48] capital or the LPU capital is coming
[00:34:50] from?
[00:34:51] >> Extremely careful. If you sell to the IC
[00:34:54] or the Department of War, you need to be
[00:34:56] extremely careful. Not just who you're
[00:34:58] taking money from, but where their money
[00:34:59] is coming from. Um, we limit the amount
[00:35:01] of foreign investment in the American
[00:35:03] Dynamism Funds very specifically to a
[00:35:05] very low number. Um, we there's a lot of
[00:35:08] uh contracts you can get in the
[00:35:09] Department of War where if your entire
[00:35:11] company is less than 5% owned by foreign
[00:35:13] investors and that's cumulatively across
[00:35:16] all your investors. You just sort of get
[00:35:18] like rubber stamped through the process.
[00:35:19] If you're more than 5% foreignowned, you
[00:35:22] have to go through a much more arduous
[00:35:23] look through of who those people are,
[00:35:25] what countries they're coming from,
[00:35:27] where the source of capital is from. So
[00:35:28] that you you certainly need to be paying
[00:35:30] attention to it. Look, if you're
[00:35:31] building um there are American Dynamis
[00:35:34] and companies where it doesn't matter as
[00:35:35] much, I'm sure, but most of our founders
[00:35:37] are very conscious of it and ask us um
[00:35:39] and we have we have the ability to
[00:35:40] answer all those questions.
[00:35:43] um SBC's
[00:35:44] >> I was I was gonna say like when when I
[00:35:46] read there was a thing in the um was it
[00:35:48] the Financial Times or something the
[00:35:49] other day where there was like they put
[00:35:51] a huge stamp of like um a sovereign
[00:35:53] wealth fund because like they they had a
[00:35:54] rumor that we were fundraising and it's
[00:35:56] like that that sovereign wealth fund's
[00:35:57] like barely an LP in our fund. It was
[00:35:59] like amazing. So people always and the
[00:36:01] public always thinks that our money
[00:36:03] comes from all kinds of places but it
[00:36:04] mostly comes from the United States. as
[00:36:06] a founder, you actually can ask
[00:36:08] investors when you're fundraising where
[00:36:09] their capital comes from. But hopefully
[00:36:12] you have the leverage to do that versus,
[00:36:13] you know, just needing the capital.
[00:36:15] >> In AD, it's not an offensive question. I
[00:36:17] think it's a reasonable question for
[00:36:18] somebody to ask us and we we have a
[00:36:20] whole set of answers.
[00:36:21] >> Uh so SBC attracts very talented,
[00:36:24] ambitious people who who do want to
[00:36:26] solve big problems, but sometimes they
[00:36:29] come to us and even we fund them when
[00:36:31] they don't have an idea. What are the
[00:36:32] areas that you think are underserved
[00:36:34] right now that people that you wish
[00:36:36] people were pursuing?
[00:36:37] >> Oh boy. We, you know, we we always shy
[00:36:40] away from the like request for startup
[00:36:42] thing um that I know other people do,
[00:36:45] which is fine. I think it's I just don't
[00:36:47] I think we're like we're never smarter
[00:36:49] than the founders. Like the founders
[00:36:50] know what's interesting and exciting. Um
[00:36:55] I still think public safety has a huge
[00:36:57] amount of opportunity. Um, like I said,
[00:36:59] we we just recently did a software only
[00:37:01] company that um it's a software tool to
[00:37:04] help detectives do investigations. So,
[00:37:06] like, you know, in San Francisco, there
[00:37:08] might be hundreds of home burglaries.
[00:37:10] The the cops don't have the resources to
[00:37:12] take all the data and evidence to
[00:37:13] investigate those. They they kind of do,
[00:37:15] not at any fault of their own. They do
[00:37:17] the bare minimum just to help you like
[00:37:19] with your insurance paperwork, your
[00:37:20] homeowners insurance. Um, but the
[00:37:22] reality is if there's hundreds of home
[00:37:24] breakins, chances are a lot of those are
[00:37:26] all being done by the same little ring
[00:37:27] of criminals. But you need to be able to
[00:37:29] ingest all the evidence to like analyze
[00:37:31] it um and actually start to sift out all
[00:37:34] the the patterns and say, "Wait a
[00:37:35] minute, there's like a crime syndicate
[00:37:36] here. Let's go stop those criminals and
[00:37:38] we stop all these burglaries." So, we
[00:37:40] invested in a company that does that.
[00:37:41] But that's just like one example. And if
[00:37:43] you dig into public safety, first
[00:37:45] responders,
[00:37:47] um 911 response com, a lot of cities
[00:37:50] want to provide 311, which we have here
[00:37:52] in New York, but a lot of cities don't
[00:37:53] have it because they don't have the
[00:37:54] ability to staff a 311 um phone number.
[00:37:57] You could do that with with AI um
[00:38:00] agents, obviously. Um I I just think in
[00:38:02] in the overall like public safety space,
[00:38:04] there's still tremendous opportunity,
[00:38:06] and we're just scratching the surface.
[00:38:08] Um there's only two. Flock Safety is a
[00:38:11] leading public safety company. Axon,
[00:38:12] which makes body cams and tasers is
[00:38:14] another leading company. Um, it's just
[00:38:16] Motorola is another one. There's just
[00:38:18] not the incumbents are not that big. Um,
[00:38:21] and I think there's still a ton of
[00:38:22] opportunity there. The if you shift your
[00:38:25] lens left, so if you look at like
[00:38:28] defense and you say, well, what does a
[00:38:30] company like and need? They need motors,
[00:38:32] they need batteries, they need carbon
[00:38:34] fiber, they need um all these other
[00:38:36] materials in their to do all the do they
[00:38:39] need optics. Um they need PCBs, they
[00:38:42] need all these things. So it's like,
[00:38:44] okay, well, where do PCBs come from and
[00:38:45] are they good? Um so we invested in a
[00:38:48] PCB design tool kind of automation
[00:38:50] company actually based here in New York
[00:38:51] called diode. Um, but like there's
[00:38:54] there's like of those that I just
[00:38:56] listed, we only have investments in a
[00:38:57] couple of those categories. And I'm just
[00:39:00] listing off five that I can think of
[00:39:01] right now, but there's probably 25
[00:39:03] things that are like that are supply
[00:39:05] chain dependent on. So if you shift left
[00:39:07] of like the defense industrial base, you
[00:39:09] get into the supply chain and the supply
[00:39:11] chain industrial base. And then you get
[00:39:12] into the precursor materials and all the
[00:39:14] chemicals you need. And there's
[00:39:16] companies there that have not yet been
[00:39:18] started that need to be started to
[00:39:20] supply those things. there's very little
[00:39:21] carbon fiber made here in the United
[00:39:23] States, but it's critical for aerospace
[00:39:24] and defense. Can you do that in a more
[00:39:26] efficient, high margin, automated way?
[00:39:29] Um, same with energy. Like, so like when
[00:39:32] I look at when I say shift left, I mean
[00:39:34] like look at all the things in defense
[00:39:35] and then like what are all the things
[00:39:37] that power that you get into materials,
[00:39:39] you get into supply chain, you get into
[00:39:40] precursors, you get into minerals, rare
[00:39:42] earths, magnets, motors, actuators,
[00:39:45] rocket propellant, kinetic systems.
[00:39:48] Sounds like a great call for startups
[00:39:50] list.
[00:39:50] >> I mean, there's just a lot, but you have
[00:39:52] to be excited. You have to know a lot
[00:39:53] about it and be excited about it.
[00:39:55] >> Well, well, uh, I'm gonna open up for
[00:39:56] questions now. Are going to request,
[00:39:59] please do not pitch your company. You
[00:40:01] know, be mindful there's a lot of people
[00:40:02] here.
[00:40:03] >> Nobody wants to hear you pitch here. We
[00:40:04] want to hear you pitch not here, but not
[00:40:06] here.
[00:40:14] >> Thanks for being here, David. um
[00:40:17] question is towards the start of what
[00:40:19] you started talking about with the
[00:40:20] policy angle and energy um you look at
[00:40:24] markets like Texas and they've got sort
[00:40:26] of the perfect storm to experiment with
[00:40:29] a lot of the technologies in the power
[00:40:31] space um as well as in the residential
[00:40:34] space which is not possible yet in the
[00:40:36] rest of the country. So rather than
[00:40:38] waiting and watching and trying to hope
[00:40:41] for all of those policies to shift and
[00:40:44] and be able to build these businesses,
[00:40:47] um what do you recommend people doing uh
[00:40:49] next? You know, people who don't come
[00:40:51] from the policy side, people who are
[00:40:53] just ready to deploy the technology
[00:40:55] because it exists. Yeah, I mean look in
[00:40:58] that in that example the Urkott region I
[00:41:00] think other markets are in the process
[00:41:02] of deregulating their energy markets but
[00:41:03] Urkott is deregulated and we have a
[00:41:05] company called base energy that is that
[00:41:07] is that's situated in Austin and is
[00:41:10] focused on the Texas market and feels
[00:41:12] like not only is it a large enough
[00:41:13] market to get started and to even get to
[00:41:15] meaningful size like you know when we
[00:41:17] look at the financial models for a
[00:41:19] company like Bass they can become a
[00:41:20] massive company just in Texas and we
[00:41:23] have to believe that other states will
[00:41:25] see in other regions It's not the
[00:41:28] utilities are not just done on a
[00:41:29] state-by-state basis, but the other
[00:41:31] regions of the of the energy grid will
[00:41:33] see what the benefits are to what's
[00:41:36] happening in Texas and will start to op
[00:41:38] allow homeowners the same way they
[00:41:40] allowed solar and pushing power back
[00:41:42] onto the grid for solar that they will
[00:41:44] allow homeowners to have more
[00:41:45] flexibility and more choice. And as the
[00:41:48] grid continues to age and become less
[00:41:50] and less stable and our demands on the
[00:41:53] grid continue to grow as we shift to EVs
[00:41:55] and people have and and even in these
[00:41:57] different regions the AI compute needs
[00:41:59] continue to grow but even if you take
[00:42:01] the AI part away we still have an
[00:42:02] insatiable thirst for for electricity
[00:42:04] and I think we'll see that the the
[00:42:07] regulatory change will still will
[00:42:08] happen. In fact, today I met with the
[00:42:11] the people in the the governor or the
[00:42:15] state of Michigan's governor's office
[00:42:16] and they're just like, "What can we do
[00:42:18] to help bring startups to Michigan?" And
[00:42:19] it's like, "Well, what? They don't need
[00:42:20] grants. They don't need money. They need
[00:42:22] regulatory support." Like, that is the
[00:42:24] thing. And we had we had the the um
[00:42:28] ex-checker of the United Kingdom visit
[00:42:30] our office um earlier this year and
[00:42:32] she's like, "What can we do to bring
[00:42:33] companies to the UK?" And it's like,
[00:42:35] "You don't need to fund these companies.
[00:42:37] you just need to like stop killing them
[00:42:38] and stop destroying them. Like just give
[00:42:40] them regulatory support. Allow companies
[00:42:42] to do manufacturing in the UK. Allow
[00:42:44] them to hire and fire people the way
[00:42:45] they want, you know, and allow them to
[00:42:47] actually have an environment that's
[00:42:48] conducive to setting up shop. And the
[00:42:50] same is for sure true in energy.
[00:42:58] >> David, thank you for the interesting
[00:42:59] Q&A. Um, actually there's a question off
[00:43:02] the back of what you had just said. Um,
[00:43:04] do you have a wish list for regulatory
[00:43:06] changes that you'd like to see? You
[00:43:08] know, things like I know NEPA is often
[00:43:11] referenced. Um, I know that we're not
[00:43:13] processing rare earth materials due to
[00:43:15] regulatory reasons. Can you share a
[00:43:17] couple that you think are opportunities
[00:43:18] for changes? Yeah. So we we've published
[00:43:20] one called dynamic tech defense reform
[00:43:23] which has a list of five priorities to
[00:43:25] just make a more level playing field for
[00:43:27] defense procurement and to provide air
[00:43:29] cover for the program um officers and
[00:43:31] acquisitions officers in the department
[00:43:33] of war so that they don't feel like
[00:43:35] they're not going to get promoted if
[00:43:36] they don't pick Lockheed's solution or
[00:43:38] you know RA which which happens over and
[00:43:40] over because it's like you know nobody
[00:43:41] got fired for buying IBM. It's like that
[00:43:43] kind of a thing. So, you want to give
[00:43:45] people the air cover to pick an inc a
[00:43:47] non-incumbent solution. And, you know,
[00:43:49] sometimes that means letting people
[00:43:50] press the I believe button. And so,
[00:43:52] that's those those five independent
[00:43:55] reforms need to be passed in a bill that
[00:43:57] both the um House and Senate would would
[00:44:00] have to to pass. Um, so we've published
[00:44:03] that on our site. I think in energy, the
[00:44:05] NRC has been historically a huge
[00:44:08] roadblock. This is the the Nuclear
[00:44:09] Regulatory Commission. Um, this is under
[00:44:11] the Department of Energy. um you know
[00:44:14] there's tremendous support bipartisan
[00:44:17] across the government um for energy
[00:44:21] solutions but then the actual regulators
[00:44:24] themselves get in the way and so I mean
[00:44:27] I would just say I guess this is being
[00:44:29] recorded so I should say it nicely but
[00:44:30] like maybe we if if we haven't approved
[00:44:33] a new and brought online a new nuclear
[00:44:36] reactor design that's like SMR and
[00:44:38] smaller in the last 50 years in this
[00:44:39] country that's not a research reactor
[00:44:41] like maybe we should change the
[00:44:42] regulators out for people that actually
[00:44:44] want to promote nuclear energy in this
[00:44:46] country um and view it as a pathway to
[00:44:49] clean um enduring energy. Um and I I
[00:44:52] don't is there anyone here that's like
[00:44:54] doesn't believe that nuclear energy is
[00:44:55] clean energy? Do I need to address that?
[00:44:57] Okay. Zero people have ever died from a
[00:44:59] nuclear power incident in this country
[00:45:00] ever in history compared to the hundreds
[00:45:03] of thousands of people that die from
[00:45:04] coal and um oil power all the time, you
[00:45:08] know, over over many decades in this
[00:45:10] country. So, um I think that's it. And
[00:45:13] um our list continues to grow. Some of
[00:45:14] this we do behind closed doors and
[00:45:16] sometimes we do it publicly like the
[00:45:17] dynamic tech defense reform.
[00:45:21] Maybe in the back there's somebody
[00:45:24] wearing a nice sport coat also dressed
[00:45:26] up.
[00:45:27] >> I don't want to beat the policy dead
[00:45:29] horse, but I do work for a policy think
[00:45:31] tank, so it's my dead horse to beat. Um
[00:45:34] >> thank thank you for your service. Of
[00:45:36] course, [laughter]
[00:45:37] it's thankless. But for companies, we're
[00:45:41] stopping the regulators,
[00:45:43] beating them to death is not enough and
[00:45:45] government intervention is needed in
[00:45:48] some form to support the market. What's
[00:45:50] the best way for the government to do it
[00:45:51] without picking winners and losers? Is
[00:45:53] it more advanced market commitments? Is
[00:45:55] it is that the best way? Are there
[00:45:56] alternatives that you're seeing?
[00:45:58] >> Sure. I mean, I'll give an example that
[00:45:59] the Department of War is now promoting.
[00:46:01] So, um, bake offs. So rather than saying
[00:46:05] that we're just going to award a
[00:46:06] contract to somebody based on their past
[00:46:08] performance, instead we're going to say
[00:46:10] that, you know, on May 1st, everyone's
[00:46:13] going to meet in the desert and is going
[00:46:15] to demonstrate this capability that
[00:46:17] fulfills these requirements. It's, you
[00:46:19] know, this percent made in America with
[00:46:20] these parts. So it's NDAA compliant. It
[00:46:23] holds this kind of a munition inside of
[00:46:25] it. So we can load in the munition. It
[00:46:26] has this kinds of communications
[00:46:28] capabilities. and whoever can show up
[00:46:30] with their, let's say, missile or
[00:46:31] whatever it is, turn it on, fire it, hit
[00:46:34] the target, wins the like $500 million
[00:46:36] bounty, and is a guaranteed contract.
[00:46:38] You don't need to pick the winner. Just
[00:46:39] say that there will a be a winner and
[00:46:41] that it will be a fair fight. And if
[00:46:43] they do that, and and we've seen this
[00:46:44] now happen, the Department of War has
[00:46:46] done this in electronic warfare bakeoffs
[00:46:49] now. Um, and it's like you go to these
[00:46:51] bake offs and the legacy incumbent can't
[00:46:53] even turn on their machine. Like
[00:46:54] something went wrong. They can't even
[00:46:55] turn it on. And you know, Anderrol comes
[00:46:57] in and just like, you know, do dominates
[00:46:58] the competition. Seronic comes in,
[00:47:00] dominates the the competition. And so
[00:47:03] making those kinds of bake offs is
[00:47:05] great. It's like X-P prize for the
[00:47:06] Department of War. Those are some
[00:47:08] examples. I think even just more
[00:47:10] fundamental things. again specifying
[00:47:14] um capabilities you need to requ that
[00:47:16] that you need to satisfy instead of
[00:47:18] actually specifying like we just want to
[00:47:20] get like like we don't need Congress to
[00:47:22] say that we want five um joint strike
[00:47:25] fighters say that you want five planes
[00:47:28] that can satisfy this exact set of
[00:47:30] requirements. That way 20 years from now
[00:47:33] when there's some program officer who
[00:47:35] has budget authority isn't stuck buying
[00:47:37] the joint strike fighter can actually
[00:47:38] buy the new thing that satisfies those
[00:47:41] requirements but isn't like literally
[00:47:43] called the Lockheed you know joint
[00:47:45] strike fighter or whatever. So, you
[00:47:47] know, a lot of times things will get put
[00:47:49] into the appropriations bills with the
[00:47:51] actual name of what they what they are
[00:47:53] and that doesn't make it makes sense
[00:47:55] tomorrow, but it doesn't make sense 10
[00:47:57] years from now when these contracts are
[00:47:58] still enduring and you actually don't
[00:48:00] want that thing anymore. You want the
[00:48:01] newer better thing from a different
[00:48:02] company. So, those are a couple and
[00:48:04] there's again a long list, but the
[00:48:05] reason that we opened up an office in DC
[00:48:07] is to be able to advance these things on
[00:48:09] the on behalf of our companies and we
[00:48:11] have a whole policy team and and we we
[00:48:13] you know, we fight this fight. We go and
[00:48:15] meet with members of Congress. We meet
[00:48:17] with the people that write the
[00:48:18] legislation in the House Armed Services
[00:48:20] Committee and the Senate Armed Services
[00:48:21] Committee. And then we also spend time
[00:48:23] with people that actually do procurement
[00:48:25] in the Department of War or in the IC to
[00:48:27] make sure that they are that our
[00:48:29] companies are able to talk to these
[00:48:30] people and make sure that we're building
[00:48:31] the right things and that they know that
[00:48:33] our companies exist.
[00:48:37] But the positive thing I'll say, sorry,
[00:48:39] is that the government is like there's
[00:48:41] so many people that want change that a
[00:48:43] lot of them need the air cover. Like you
[00:48:45] can, you know, you can be annoyed at
[00:48:47] some of the things you hear on the news
[00:48:48] and like some of the like bombastic
[00:48:49] stuff, but like a lot of it is providing
[00:48:51] air cover for people that are real
[00:48:53] patriotic people that just need the air
[00:48:55] cover to say, "I'm not going to go do
[00:48:56] the old thing. I'm going to try a new
[00:48:58] thing."
[00:49:02] Hey, do you think New York's ready for a
[00:49:05] company like Flock Safety?
[00:49:07] >> You mean like as a customer or like to
[00:49:09] be building a company here?
[00:49:10] >> As a customer.
[00:49:11] >> Oh yeah, for sure. Like NYPD buys SkyO
[00:49:14] today. They have thousands of cameras
[00:49:16] all over the city. They unfortunately
[00:49:18] have very crappy technology to aggregate
[00:49:20] all that video and they don't have good
[00:49:21] AI capabilities to ingest it all and
[00:49:23] analyze it all. Um, but like the CTO of
[00:49:26] NYPD is very, very smart. We've spent
[00:49:28] time with him. Like Commissioner Tish is
[00:49:30] incredibly smart. Um, for sure we're
[00:49:33] ready for drone. Like they have drones.
[00:49:35] They have Skyio drones here in New York.
[00:49:37] Um, and we're definitely ready for flock
[00:49:39] safety. They have Shot Spotter, which is
[00:49:40] like a a more legacy technology. Flock
[00:49:42] safety, I think, you know, I'm biased,
[00:49:44] but has a much better capability. Um,
[00:49:46] we're totally ready for for flock safety
[00:49:48] here.
[00:49:52] >> Thank you so much, David. Actually going
[00:49:54] on to the public safety part. How do you
[00:49:56] build uh companies for the public
[00:49:58] safety? For example, for most startups,
[00:49:59] you would go and and speak to people. Is
[00:50:01] it presenting a complete solution? Is it
[00:50:03] speaking with specific officers?
[00:50:05] Speaking with the uh heads of the
[00:50:07] departments.
[00:50:08] >> Yeah. So, um this is always I think it's
[00:50:10] an excellent question like how do you go
[00:50:12] build a public safety gun? Like how do
[00:50:13] you go sell how do you sell the cops is
[00:50:15] basically like the question which is a
[00:50:17] very reasonable question. So, and I'm
[00:50:19] not I'm gonna make an stupid answer, but
[00:50:21] like you call them um you call the chief
[00:50:24] of police. Like we you'll send an email
[00:50:26] to the chief of police and say like,
[00:50:27] "Hey, I'm with this company. We have
[00:50:28] this technology. We have this
[00:50:30] capability. We would love to show it to
[00:50:31] you." And look, they have to go get
[00:50:33] approval oftentimes from city council or
[00:50:36] the mayor, depends on their their area,
[00:50:38] but you need to have a champion. And
[00:50:39] that champion is often going to be a
[00:50:41] lieutenant or the chief of police or the
[00:50:42] sheriff in your in your jurisdiction.
[00:50:45] And it's hard to get the first, but you
[00:50:47] start you do what you start by doing if
[00:50:49] you're if you're sort of pre-product,
[00:50:50] you start by doing ride alongs. You call
[00:50:52] up the lieutenant. Like if you go to
[00:50:53] NYPD, you can look up your um burrow
[00:50:56] that you're you're in and you can look
[00:50:58] at the um the precinct that you're a
[00:50:59] part of. And then they they literally
[00:51:01] list the like community liaison officers
[00:51:04] of your precinct. You just like they
[00:51:06] have their email. Sometimes they have
[00:51:07] their phone number and you call them
[00:51:08] just like any other sales like
[00:51:09] enterprise sales and you call you know
[00:51:11] you've all been on the receiving end of
[00:51:12] like sales pitches. You call them, you
[00:51:14] say, "Hey, I'm building this technology
[00:51:16] that's going to look at your body cam
[00:51:18] footage and tell you if officers are
[00:51:20] feeling fatigued." Like that's that's a
[00:51:22] company. It's not one we're invested in,
[00:51:23] but like that exists. We're just going
[00:51:24] to tell you if officers are feeling
[00:51:26] fatigued by analyzing body cam footage
[00:51:28] so that you can actually help that
[00:51:30] officer get some support before they
[00:51:31] have like a huge blow up with a with a
[00:51:34] um a citizen interaction. Like they're
[00:51:36] getting fatigued, they're getting
[00:51:37] agitated over the course of days and
[00:51:38] weeks. maybe they have issues at home
[00:51:40] and we can look at the body cam footage
[00:51:41] and prevent them from having a really
[00:51:43] bad altercation with a a member of the
[00:51:45] public. Okay, good idea. Sounds good.
[00:51:47] You call a community uh liaison officer
[00:51:49] and they're going to be like, "You know
[00:51:50] what? That's kind of interesting. Why
[00:51:51] don't you do a ride along with two two
[00:51:53] of our cops that are kind of interested
[00:51:54] in that and uh you can learn more about
[00:51:56] their day-to-day police work and you
[00:51:58] know, if they want to let you look at
[00:51:59] their body cam footage, like we can we
[00:52:01] can facilitate that." And then they do
[00:52:02] and then you're like, "Great, do you
[00:52:03] want to buy it?" And then they're like,
[00:52:03] "Yeah, we'll buy it." It's just like I
[00:52:05] mean it's like sales. I mean it sounds
[00:52:06] dumb. It sounds dumb, but like that it's
[00:52:09] just it is just it's a lot of it is just
[00:52:11] like enterprise sales like you know and
[00:52:13] sometimes it just comes down to spending
[00:52:14] time with your customer just like you
[00:52:16] know like design partners and um I'll
[00:52:19] use an example Aerodome which is a
[00:52:20] company that we invested in that got
[00:52:21] bought by Fox Safety. Um the founder of
[00:52:24] that company happens to be an active
[00:52:26] duty officer with Roondo Beach Police
[00:52:28] Department in Los Angeles. So he was
[00:52:30] just like hey captain I'm building this
[00:52:31] thing like can we use it? And the
[00:52:32] captain's like great. Do I have to pay
[00:52:33] for it? No. Great. Okay. So then and
[00:52:36] then like another police member is like,
[00:52:37] "Oh, Red Roondo's using it. I'll buy
[00:52:38] it." And then then they buy it. And
[00:52:40] there's more hurdles. I'm being a little
[00:52:42] bit flippant. Like again, you might have
[00:52:44] to go like at Flock Safety's level, they
[00:52:46] have an entire um team that pairs with
[00:52:49] the sales team that helps and arm the
[00:52:53] not literally arm, arm the um police
[00:52:55] chief with all the collateral you need
[00:52:57] of like how this helps stop crime so
[00:52:58] that your city council will approve it
[00:53:00] and give you the budget to buy it. Um so
[00:53:02] it's a very good question. Um, but by
[00:53:04] the way, the same thing is true in in
[00:53:06] Department of War. Like you find a
[00:53:07] customer, you find that they have
[00:53:08] budget, and you like go sell to them.
[00:53:16] Let me ask this. Would it be useful if
[00:53:18] we did more like basic like sales 101
[00:53:20] for defense and public safety?
[00:53:25] >> [laughter]
[00:53:27] >> We're not we're not going to do that
[00:53:28] here, but maybe but may maybe we will do
[00:53:31] more um more go to market work because
[00:53:34] the policy stuff and the go to market
[00:53:36] stuff go hand in hand.
[00:53:38] >> Uh this is uh about like the China
[00:53:42] hardware uh humanoid robot stuff. Um so
[00:53:45] you kind of said we don't necessarily
[00:53:46] need to compete on hardware. We can
[00:53:48] probably just have our software run. I'm
[00:53:51] uh I wanted to get your take on like why
[00:53:53] like what's the moat for us our software
[00:53:56] like um or is it not that there's a moat
[00:53:59] it's just that you expect it to be we we
[00:54:03] should have like a better software
[00:54:05] reaction to this. So I I guess I'll give
[00:54:07] a finer point answer to the one that I
[00:54:09] gave which is that there are parts of
[00:54:11] the hardware stack we need to be able to
[00:54:13] build for security reasons for
[00:54:16] resiliency reasons for supply chain
[00:54:18] reasons like I do think we need to have
[00:54:20] the ability to make PCBs and
[00:54:22] semiconductors maybe not the like most
[00:54:25] advanced tune nanometer but eventually
[00:54:27] probably that also but we need to be
[00:54:28] able to make chips and circuit boards in
[00:54:31] this country we there's a whole variety
[00:54:33] of reasons why that is the case but we
[00:54:35] need to be able do that. Do we need to
[00:54:37] be able to make commodity actuators in
[00:54:38] this country? I'm I'm not sure. So, I
[00:54:40] guess that was more my point. And then
[00:54:42] even the like assembly of the full
[00:54:44] humanoid? Sure, we could assemble it
[00:54:45] here. Maybe we can assemble it actually
[00:54:47] at low cost in Mexico um or another
[00:54:49] market where the labor supply is is less
[00:54:51] expensive. Maybe maybe we can do it
[00:54:53] here. I don't know. I don't think we
[00:54:54] have to win that part. The reason I
[00:54:55] think that we have to be better at the
[00:54:57] software, um, a I think we can, and b,
[00:55:01] there are, I think, going to be
[00:55:02] significant markets where you're going
[00:55:03] to want the software to be American
[00:55:04] software or allied software, and you're
[00:55:07] going to have the ability to deploy the
[00:55:08] software on these devices. Um, I mean,
[00:55:11] today, if you're in the drone market,
[00:55:13] you know that like the hardware in the
[00:55:15] drone market and the software in the
[00:55:16] drone market have have been completely
[00:55:18] separated. Um, and so like in the
[00:55:20] Ukraine there might be 30 different
[00:55:22] versions of software that all running on
[00:55:24] the same basic drone platform doing
[00:55:27] different missions. Some might be doing
[00:55:28] ISR, some are basically like, you know,
[00:55:30] a glorified mortar like a grenade. Um,
[00:55:33] and so there's all kinds of different
[00:55:34] missions now and they've they've really
[00:55:35] separated the software out and you have
[00:55:37] to I have to imagine that robotics will
[00:55:39] be the same because there's so many
[00:55:41] different missions for for robots.
[00:55:45] I I don't know if that was a sufficient
[00:55:46] answer, but I think that's why and I
[00:55:48] think people lots of customers in the US
[00:55:50] and or allied countries will just want
[00:55:52] uh a n a sovereign solution more or
[00:55:55] less.
[00:55:56] >> We've never one last question.
[00:56:01] >> Thank um you briefly spoke about the
[00:56:04] idea of kind of the death valley um in
[00:56:06] funding of startups obviously
[00:56:07] particularly um very prominent for
[00:56:09] hardware startups. I'm curious if you're
[00:56:11] seeing any patterns among companies who
[00:56:13] are successfully getting through that
[00:56:14] death valley in the likes of uh
[00:56:16] manufacturing and hardware.
[00:56:17] >> Yeah. So I think and and you can Google
[00:56:20] and read more about yeah what what was
[00:56:21] like classically called like the valley
[00:56:23] of of death in def in defense
[00:56:25] procurement in specific. I think that a
[00:56:26] lot of it's just gone away because the
[00:56:28] government customer is much more willing
[00:56:29] to take risks. there's a lot more
[00:56:31] capital available for that middle sort
[00:56:33] of tier of of R&D grants of cyber
[00:56:36] contracts um of smaller OTAAS that are
[00:56:39] available other contracting vehicles um
[00:56:41] and alternative contracting vehicles.
[00:56:43] So, it's not that it's solved for all
[00:56:45] companies, but it's and not again, I try
[00:56:47] not to give flippant answers, but like
[00:56:48] it's solved for the good companies
[00:56:50] because
[00:56:52] um it used to be that you could be a
[00:56:54] good company and not be able to get a
[00:56:57] $50 million contract until you were
[00:56:58] waiting for your $500 million contract.
[00:57:00] That has largely, I think, been been
[00:57:02] solved. The other thing is you have to
[00:57:03] remember companies like SpaceX and
[00:57:05] Palanteer had to sue the government in
[00:57:07] order to make contracts more fair. that
[00:57:09] is also I think you know they sort of
[00:57:11] like they they like crawled and walked
[00:57:13] so that we can run now and I think we
[00:57:15] should recognize like the work that
[00:57:16] those companies did because you know
[00:57:19] SpaceX's largest customer is the
[00:57:21] government and they had to sue NASA um I
[00:57:24] think more than once and it's you know
[00:57:26] it's very scary to sue your largest
[00:57:27] customer um but they did and they won
[00:57:30] and and and they did that to make the
[00:57:32] contracting process more fair and we are
[00:57:35] all now beneficiaries of that so so much
[00:57:37] work has gone into narrowing that gap
[00:57:38] app. Um, I think the part that's
[00:57:40] incumbent on the founders is the being a
[00:57:43] very good uh fiduciary of your capital
[00:57:46] and and you know not running out of
[00:57:48] money because you don't understand what
[00:57:51] your financing path looks like, what
[00:57:54] your fundraising um opportunity looks
[00:57:56] like. And you know, it's [snorts] always
[00:57:58] like investors will always say that if
[00:58:00] someone's offering you money, you should
[00:58:01] probably take it because we don't know
[00:58:02] what the future will look like. It's
[00:58:03] certainly I think the most true in
[00:58:05] American dynamism. Like it's a great
[00:58:06] time to be raising money and if
[00:58:08] someone's offering you money I highly
[00:58:09] recommend taking it because like we
[00:58:11] don't know what the world will look like
[00:58:12] in a year. I think that the world will
[00:58:14] like I said the world will continue to
[00:58:15] be spicy but like fundraising markets
[00:58:17] kind of eb and flow and are very like
[00:58:19] short-term oriented despite the
[00:58:21] long-term investments we make.
[00:58:24] >> All right. Well, one last one at the
[00:58:26] back.
[00:58:33] just
[00:58:35] um you know it's interesting that you
[00:58:37] say take the capital now when you can
[00:58:39] hardware tends to be agnostic of the
[00:58:41] markets like even in 2021 we saw it was
[00:58:43] pretty agnostic towards massive dips
[00:58:45] there. Um do you foresee that happening
[00:58:47] in this next kind of like bubble period
[00:58:49] whether you want to put a magic ball
[00:58:51] quote on on when you see it popping and
[00:58:54] what that happens with the dual use
[00:58:55] companies and hardware companies.
[00:58:59] >> Um how do I
[00:59:02] I think that there is more capital
[00:59:04] around today that is less fixated on
[00:59:08] what the exit multiples will be of what
[00:59:10] have historically been low margin
[00:59:12] hardware companies because there's a
[00:59:14] belief that either um trends in the way
[00:59:18] that the procurement process works, the
[00:59:20] ultimate size of these markets, um the
[00:59:22] automation you'll get through
[00:59:23] manufacturing changes and and software
[00:59:25] applied to that or robotics applied to
[00:59:26] that will make these higher margins. But
[00:59:29] we are at a moment now where I think
[00:59:31] investors are paying less attention to
[00:59:33] at least the historical exit multiples
[00:59:35] of hardware companies and therefore it's
[00:59:37] a great time to raise money for those
[00:59:39] kinds of companies and that may not
[00:59:40] always be true. Um I think one
[00:59:43] difference in 2021's like exuberance is
[00:59:45] like those were mostly software
[00:59:47] companies that sort of got really like
[00:59:49] you know tiger global like exploded
[00:59:51] valuations and things. Um, I think we're
[00:59:54] seeing hardware companies now see get
[00:59:56] some of that benefit or at least not get
[00:59:58] the penalty applied and you know again I
[01:00:00] don't know if that will last forever. So
[01:00:01] it feels better for AD companies now
[01:00:04] than it ever has been and you know
[01:00:06] things come and go. Now that said if you
[01:00:08] invested in a great company in 2021 even
[01:00:10] at a high price you probably feel pretty
[01:00:11] good now. Um, you know I'm sure OpenAI
[01:00:14] was a high price in 2021 but you feel
[01:00:16] great now. Um, if you invested in any of
[01:00:18] these companies in 2021 if they're good
[01:00:20] you feel great. If they weren't good you
[01:00:21] don't. That's always the way it is. So,
[01:00:24] you know, it's like the job is to invest
[01:00:26] in good companies.
[01:00:28] >> And if you're building good companies,
[01:00:29] come pitch both of us. Thank you so much
[01:00:31] for coming. A huge round of applause.
[01:00:35] [applause]
