[00:00:00] Rhys Hughes here, part of our talent
[00:00:01] partner team here at GV, kicking off a
[00:00:03] series of talent discussions with
[00:00:04] exceptional founders building
[00:00:05] missiondriven companies. I'm thrilled
[00:00:07] today to be here with Sal Magos, founder
[00:00:09] and CEO of Metav. MeteView is a AI
[00:00:12] platform I wish I so desperately had
[00:00:14] back when I was running talent teams and
[00:00:16] hiring hundreds of people. Uh I'll let S
[00:00:19] talk more about the business in a
[00:00:20] minute, but welcome to the Ferry
[00:00:22] Building. We're thrilled to have you
[00:00:23] here. Um congratulations on opening the
[00:00:25] office here in in San Francisco. Um,
[00:00:27] even more exciting to have a founder
[00:00:29] who's started out of London and uh, we
[00:00:31] love investing in the European
[00:00:32] marketplace as well. So, so huge
[00:00:33] welcome.
[00:00:34] >> Thanks so much. Pumped to be here.
[00:00:35] Pumped to have this chat.
[00:00:36] >> Why don't we start a little bit on your
[00:00:38] background? Let's let's hear a little
[00:00:39] bit about your journey. You and Sher
[00:00:41] started this company uh, not long ago,
[00:00:43] but be curious to hear about why this
[00:00:45] company and and obviously your
[00:00:46] background. Let's let's start there.
[00:00:48] >> I think for us it was a classic classic
[00:00:50] starting point of scratching your own
[00:00:51] itch. Uh Sher and I used to work
[00:00:53] together um at a series A startup in
[00:00:55] London, a fintech startup in London many
[00:00:57] years ago now. I went on to join Uber on
[00:01:00] the product team there. He went on to
[00:01:01] join Palanteer. We stayed in touch
[00:01:02] always sort of throwing around ideas. Um
[00:01:05] but we sort of never got a lot of
[00:01:06] momentum until we basically focused on
[00:01:09] things that we'd really experienced. And
[00:01:11] when you're at Uber at the time, I was
[00:01:12] at Uber 2016, 2017, 2018, large company
[00:01:16] but growing like crazy at that time.
[00:01:18] Sharet at Palanteer just this incredibly
[00:01:20] high talent bar and an incredibly
[00:01:22] rigorous process to determine who gets
[00:01:24] to join that organization. We realized
[00:01:26] that there was a I guess we had a lot of
[00:01:28] itches in in that in that in that area.
[00:01:30] And our big realization was you know as
[00:01:33] operators that were spending 20 30
[00:01:36] sometimes half your 50% of your time
[00:01:37] during a week on interviewing you really
[00:01:40] come away with a a conviction that most
[00:01:43] of hiring happens in conversations. Um
[00:01:46] uh and that was sort of the nugget that
[00:01:48] we started to or the thread we started
[00:01:50] to pull on and realize hang on if we
[00:01:52] could actually harness the data in these
[00:01:54] conversations. It stands to reason that
[00:01:57] that might be the thing that finally
[00:01:58] enables us to have just a lot more
[00:02:00] efficiency and a lot more precision in
[00:02:02] how hiring gets done.
[00:02:04] >> Taken us a pretty long time to go from
[00:02:05] that that insight that core insight
[00:02:07] which was hey we're losing all of these
[00:02:08] these nuggets of information to the
[00:02:10] ether here um to where we are now. But
[00:02:12] that was that was really the starting
[00:02:13] point. tell us what the product does to
[00:02:15] solve the problem for customers today
[00:02:16] and and perhaps insight into the road
[00:02:18] map with what you can share.
[00:02:19] >> Absolutely. So we think of our mission
[00:02:22] frankly is to figure out how humans and
[00:02:24] AI are going to work together to build
[00:02:26] teams. I think the most exciting thing
[00:02:28] on the planet right now is to figure out
[00:02:30] how humans and AI are going to work
[00:02:31] together. And we're laser focused on
[00:02:33] specifically how you going to do that to
[00:02:34] build teams. Our big thesis is that
[00:02:37] you're never going to have AI that
[00:02:39] really significantly helps you with your
[00:02:41] hiring unless it has the context that
[00:02:43] matters. And the context that matters in
[00:02:44] hiring is in the conversations. And so
[00:02:46] our platform is really focused on
[00:02:48] capturing uh hiring related
[00:02:50] conversations. A lot of time that is
[00:02:52] your interviews, but also your intake
[00:02:54] meetings when recruiters and hiring
[00:02:55] managers chat together about what
[00:02:56] they're looking for. Your debriefs when
[00:02:58] you sort of knock about all the reasons
[00:02:59] you should or shouldn't hire someone.
[00:03:01] These are all sort of dense with vital
[00:03:04] information. if you're ever going to
[00:03:05] have an AI that can significantly help
[00:03:07] you with your process. And so what our
[00:03:09] roadmap is now is we have this core
[00:03:11] notetaker product. We recently about a
[00:03:13] year ago shipped a product which was we
[00:03:15] call it AI reports which is a way to
[00:03:17] pull out almost longitudinal insights
[00:03:19] from your your c this new data asset you
[00:03:21] have which is these conversations these
[00:03:23] maybe thousands of conversations you've
[00:03:24] had with candidates. So you can start to
[00:03:26] understand things like uh you know who
[00:03:28] are my best interviewers in the company?
[00:03:29] How are compensation expectations
[00:03:31] changing over time? um how are
[00:03:33] candidates that we end up that end up
[00:03:35] rejecting an offer, what are the
[00:03:36] questions that they seem to be asking
[00:03:37] most? You can actually start to treat
[00:03:39] your interview process as a machine that
[00:03:41] you can understand and improve. Um and
[00:03:43] most recently, we've moved on to
[00:03:44] sourcing. So, uh how can AI leverage the
[00:03:48] fact that it understands the candidates
[00:03:50] that you seem to like within your
[00:03:51] interview process? How can it use that
[00:03:53] information to go and find other people
[00:03:55] out there in the world who might be a
[00:03:57] good fit for your company? So maybe if I
[00:03:59] have you go back a little bit and talk
[00:04:00] about um you've noticed a market that's
[00:04:03] been unadressed. You've created a
[00:04:05] product set that is clearly filling that
[00:04:07] void, but building the company is really
[00:04:09] really really difficult. So you're at 40
[00:04:12] employees today. You're growing fast. So
[00:04:14] um walk us through what you've learned.
[00:04:16] Like how is it? What have been some of
[00:04:18] the biggest lessons that you you've
[00:04:19] learned along the way hiring your first
[00:04:21] engineers? You're hiring some
[00:04:23] exceptional leaders right now. We're
[00:04:24] we're watching you. We're partnering
[00:04:25] with you on that as well. um walk us
[00:04:27] through the journey of building the
[00:04:29] company. It is difficult.
[00:04:30] >> I think for me it's more trusting your
[00:04:32] eyes. I think um it's less about gut but
[00:04:34] more um you see a lot of candidates of
[00:04:37] all different strokes and backgrounds
[00:04:39] and some that on paper you know based on
[00:04:41] their resume would be you know look like
[00:04:42] this would be a shoe in and sometimes
[00:04:44] you sort of want to go with that and
[00:04:46] just you know what let's let's not take
[00:04:47] the risk here this person has it on
[00:04:48] their resume but so many times you also
[00:04:51] come across incredible people who just
[00:04:52] haven't had that opportunity to show
[00:04:54] that they can operate at that level and
[00:04:55] when I look at that longitudinally I see
[00:04:57] people who maybe we thought were really
[00:04:58] exciting we didn't make take the plunge
[00:05:00] they've gone and you can look at their
[00:05:01] resume now And if you saw them again,
[00:05:03] you'd say, "Well, we should definitely
[00:05:04] hire them." So, I think getting yourself
[00:05:05] a little bit,
[00:05:07] >> you are going to live and die by the
[00:05:08] quality of the folks that you bring into
[00:05:09] your team. There is almost like a bit of
[00:05:11] a sugar rush that can be associated with
[00:05:13] hiring people that look good on paper
[00:05:14] but aren't actually the full aren't the
[00:05:16] full package.
[00:05:17] >> But you're going to be judged in two,
[00:05:18] four, five years time on the what you
[00:05:20] actually achieve. And it's really it's
[00:05:22] really sort of are you finding these
[00:05:25] people at a moment in time where they
[00:05:26] are primed and motivated to do
[00:05:28] exceptional work. and that sort of
[00:05:30] coincides with you, you know, the time
[00:05:31] that you need them to do exceptional
[00:05:33] work. That's really what I look for in
[00:05:34] people. Now,
[00:05:35] >> how do you think about that moment in
[00:05:36] time when it's time to add someone else
[00:05:39] to the business? Is it when you receive
[00:05:40] a funding round? Is it at a certain
[00:05:43] revenue level? Like when is the right
[00:05:45] time for you and the team to think about
[00:05:46] adding a leader to the business?
[00:05:48] >> Um, I don't know if I'm going to give
[00:05:50] you the best answer, but it's my answer.
[00:05:52] And you you can tell me actually if uh
[00:05:53] if you think this is the right way to
[00:05:54] think about things. Uh I I I think about
[00:05:57] it very selfishly, but I think what's
[00:06:00] good for me is I in in almost all cases
[00:06:02] is also good for MetaView. And the
[00:06:04] selfish way I think about it is listen,
[00:06:06] there's a set of things that I'm
[00:06:07] uniquely positioned to do as the CEO of
[00:06:09] Metaview. Um and any time I'm spending
[00:06:12] not doing those things, uh that's time
[00:06:15] to find someone else to do this. And in
[00:06:17] if that's scale a team, then that's a
[00:06:18] leaders that's a leader you need to hire
[00:06:20] to sort of, you know, to to to build out
[00:06:23] that that portion of the organization.
[00:06:25] For me, I spend a lot of time on sales,
[00:06:26] for example. Um, and there comes a point
[00:06:28] where, uh, well, actually really what I
[00:06:30] should be doing is dropping in, having
[00:06:32] high leverage interactions with select
[00:06:33] customers, you know, meeting with
[00:06:35] candidates, meeting with other potential
[00:06:36] future investors or existing board
[00:06:38] members. That that's sort of there's a
[00:06:40] there's a an ever growing body of work
[00:06:42] that I'm uniquely positioned to do as
[00:06:43] the CEO. And anything that pulls me away
[00:06:45] from that, I need to find someone who is
[00:06:47] better than me at that thing to scale it
[00:06:48] and take it to the next level. So I
[00:06:50] really put it through that prism of you
[00:06:52] know what am I spending time on that
[00:06:53] really for the good of met I I shouldn't
[00:06:56] be I should be spending time on these
[00:06:57] other things instead
[00:06:58] >> I'm sure you must have um other founders
[00:07:00] who are way earlier on their journey
[00:07:01] than you are today
[00:07:03] >> who are reaching out to you and saying s
[00:07:04] like what are the two three things
[00:07:06] what's the one thing even that I should
[00:07:08] be thinking out what can I not get wrong
[00:07:10] as I go on my own journey like what
[00:07:12] advice would you give an aspiring
[00:07:13] founder who who wants to go down a
[00:07:14] similar path
[00:07:15] >> if you are ever going to achieve high
[00:07:17] talent density at scale it really starts
[00:07:19] in those early days because if you're in
[00:07:20] a position when you're 20 people and you
[00:07:22] can't attract the best because they're
[00:07:23] coming in seeing the rest of your team
[00:07:24] and thinking well sure I mean the
[00:07:26] founders like got this great story and
[00:07:28] they seem to be going well but I'm not
[00:07:30] seeing it in the humans I'm like having
[00:07:32] these interactions with then uh that's
[00:07:33] where you can get screwed. So I'm very
[00:07:35] proud that we've um
[00:07:38] very determinedly stickked to this
[00:07:41] principle even when it was like easier
[00:07:42] to to maybe take a different route. Are
[00:07:44] there any techniques, any practices,
[00:07:46] anything you tell your team or
[00:07:48] demonstrate that you you do to put
[00:07:50] yourself in a position to continue to
[00:07:51] win the best talent? We do we do a ton
[00:07:53] to be honest. everything from the sort
[00:07:54] of like almost quite micro tactical at
[00:07:57] my level which is meet with people even
[00:08:00] when I don't need to that put a person
[00:08:01] in that seat right now and just really
[00:08:03] trying frankly force myself to um uh
[00:08:07] extend network in pockets that are going
[00:08:09] to ROI or going to return at some point
[00:08:11] all the way through to the much more
[00:08:13] almost like in the DNA of the company
[00:08:15] we're quite public on our let's say our
[00:08:17] LinkedIn profile about what life is like
[00:08:19] at Met I think that stuff helps we
[00:08:20] actually recently ran a paddle event
[00:08:22] here in San Isco uh 200 people turned
[00:08:25] up. This was purely a networking event
[00:08:28] for people who wanted to work in AI for
[00:08:30] AI companies. Um you know got a ton of
[00:08:32] pipeline off the back of that. Um uh we
[00:08:37] uh my co-founder and I Shar and I very
[00:08:40] present in the interview process. So
[00:08:41] frankly I'm spending you know much of my
[00:08:43] time in San Francisco and London but a
[00:08:46] lot of that time is frankly is
[00:08:47] interviewing. And so I talked earlier
[00:08:48] about hey when do you know to grow scale
[00:08:50] your scale your leadership team. When I
[00:08:52] think about something I'm uniquely
[00:08:53] positioned to do versus even people that
[00:08:55] I think are a players in my company,
[00:08:58] whether it's a head of marketing, a head
[00:08:59] of CS team, whatever, these are these
[00:09:00] are a players. But the reality is me
[00:09:02] being involved in recruiting processes
[00:09:04] earlier and getting the chance to um
[00:09:07] impress upon candidates why this is a
[00:09:09] special place. have them understand that
[00:09:11] they're going to be exposed to uh what
[00:09:13] the the type of environment they're
[00:09:15] going to be exposed to and frankly you
[00:09:16] know exposed to me as well which which
[00:09:19] is you know especially for someone early
[00:09:20] in career is like is an attractive thing
[00:09:21] like we put a ton of energy a ton of
[00:09:23] energy into that um so those are the
[00:09:25] things that sort of really top of mind I
[00:09:27] think it's really sort of I don't we
[00:09:29] don't use the phrase internally employer
[00:09:30] brand but I think we do exude an
[00:09:32] employer brand that makes people think
[00:09:33] hey that's I want to work at that
[00:09:34] company
[00:09:35] >> so we were fortunate enough to leave
[00:09:36] your series B led by Voodoo our general
[00:09:38] partner Uh what are some of the things
[00:09:40] that you rely on with your investors to
[00:09:42] help you as you grow the company?
[00:09:43] >> Yeah. Yeah. So going into the series B,
[00:09:44] we had frankly a really clear scorecard
[00:09:47] and what we were looking for for folks.
[00:09:48] Um the first most important I would say
[00:09:51] is chemistry and alignment with the
[00:09:54] individual the human being who's going
[00:09:55] to you know be a part of Metiv for the
[00:09:57] next 10, 15, 20 years however long and
[00:09:59] who knows maybe part of my life for the
[00:10:00] rest of it. Um and so that was massive
[00:10:02] for us. The second thing for us was
[00:10:04] brand. Uh and we mean that in two two
[00:10:06] dimensions. We want an unfair advantage
[00:10:09] of attracting great talent and a
[00:10:11] recognizable tier one investor is great
[00:10:14] validation of what we're doing. We also
[00:10:16] wanted a brand that really resonated
[00:10:17] with our customer. So our customers tend
[00:10:19] to be heads of talent, heads of
[00:10:21] recruiting at technology companies, but
[00:10:23] also I mean we've got a very diverse
[00:10:24] customer set. folks around the world and
[00:10:26] so being able to bring uh you know
[00:10:29] mention and sort of uh talk about the
[00:10:31] fact of we have GV as a lead investor is
[00:10:33] just massive to them because there's no
[00:10:35] there's no VC brand that resonates more
[00:10:36] with uh uh our market than than GVs.
[00:10:40] >> Thank you for sharing your experience
[00:10:41] with GV and uh the extended audience
[00:10:44] here. Um we are thrilled to be a part of
[00:10:47] this company's growth and velocity.
[00:10:49] We're thrilled that you're uh founded
[00:10:51] out of London. We love our European uh
[00:10:53] portfolio. I'm personally thrilled to
[00:10:55] have you here in San Francisco. Can't
[00:10:57] wait to spend more time with you and
[00:10:58] thank you for giving us the time today.
[00:10:59] Really appreciate it.
[00:11:00] >> Thanks so much. Bump to have you on the
[00:11:01] on the cap table.
[00:11:02] >> Thank you.
