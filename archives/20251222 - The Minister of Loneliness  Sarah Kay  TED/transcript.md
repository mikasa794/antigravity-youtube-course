[00:00:03] In the country of Japan,
[00:00:06] in the month of October 2020,
[00:00:10] more people died by suicide
[00:00:13] than had died from COVID-19
[00:00:15] in all of 2020 up to that point.
[00:00:19] In response,
[00:00:21] the Japanese government
instituted a new position
[00:00:26] of a minister of loneliness.
[00:00:32] The Minister of Loneliness
[00:00:35] has abolished email.
[00:00:38] He is installing tin cans
on every windowsill
[00:00:43] with a piece of string
[00:00:45] to someone else's window.
[00:00:48] Not several, just one.
[00:00:52] Each person, of course, does not need
a lot of people to speak to.
[00:00:56] Just the one.
[00:00:57] But the one must be reliable,
[00:00:59] must be available when needed.
[00:01:01] We are employing a buddy system now.
[00:01:05] Every day is a field trip
to the Adulthood Museum,
[00:01:09] and we don't go home until
everyone has been accounted for.
[00:01:14] The way you find your buddy
is a nationwide game of Guess Who
[00:01:19] where you sing the song
that is always stuck in your head,
[00:01:23] describe the movie you can't
get through without crying,
[00:01:26] the hardest you've ever laughed,
[00:01:28] the outfit you wish you could pull off.
[00:01:31] And the only person who can spot you
is the one you are assigned.
[00:01:36] All of Japan is a ball of string now.
[00:01:40] The economy has ground to a halt.
[00:01:43] Productivity is entirely impossible.
[00:01:46] Sometimes you go to talk
into the can on your windowsill,
[00:01:50] and a knot in the string
[00:01:52] accidentally gives you
someone else's conversation.
[00:01:55] The fading fabric
of someone else's loneliness
[00:01:58] evaporating into the air
between buildings.
[00:02:02] You are allowed to eavesdrop,
[00:02:05] but so is everyone else.
[00:02:07] The Minister of Loneliness
has moved all kindergartens
[00:02:11] to the ground floor
of elderly assisted-living centers.
[00:02:15] There are daily story hours.
[00:02:17] Animal shelters across the street.
[00:02:20] The Minister of Loneliness
has not abolished Valentine's Day,
[00:02:24] but has instituted a nationwide
"bring enough for the class" regulation
[00:02:29] and nobody goes home empty handed.
[00:02:32] The Minister of Loneliness
has prescribed therapy for everyone,
[00:02:37] daily walks through the many gardens,
[00:02:40] opportunities for meditation
by a brook, in the rain,
[00:02:44] under falling blossoms
or along a snowy riverbank,
[00:02:47] depending on the season.
[00:02:49] He has commissioned musicians
and actors and poets
[00:02:52] to create concerts
and radio plays and poetry readings,
[00:02:56] to be pumped across the knotted
tin-can radio lines every evening.
[00:03:01] When you order dinner for one,
[00:03:03] the person who delivers it
[00:03:05] arrives with an appropriate ability
[00:03:07] and comfort level dance instruction video
[00:03:10] and two hours to spare.
[00:03:13] Grieving is encouraged
[00:03:15] and art-making is rampant.
[00:03:17] But because of the knots,
[00:03:19] sometimes when you are expecting
a visit from a grief counselor,
[00:03:23] the dance partner food
delivery arrives instead.
[00:03:26] Sometimes they are the same person.
[00:03:29] The Minister of Loneliness isn't tired.
[00:03:32] He is the most popular man in the country.
[00:03:35] He has a crush on a middle-school
teacher across town,
[00:03:38] and everyone eavesdrops
[00:03:40] to hear the way he stumbles
when she answers.
[00:03:42] Everyone is on the edge of their seats.
[00:03:45] Everyone forgets about dying
[00:03:47] because they can't wait
to find out what happens next.
[00:03:50] Everyone has opinions.
[00:03:51] The minister has to start a hotline
[00:03:54] where people can call in
to tell him their thoughts.
[00:03:57] The tin cans rattle non-stop.
[00:03:59] The minister is grateful for the advice
[00:04:02] but is nervous his crush
will hear the commotion.
[00:04:05] He is nervous she prefers quiet,
[00:04:08] but he does not know for sure yet.
[00:04:10] He does not know what she is thinking,
[00:04:13] does not know how
she spends her Saturdays,
[00:04:16] or how she prefers her tea,
[00:04:18] or whether she likes to walk in the rain.
[00:04:22] But he likes wondering.
[00:04:25] When nobody is paying attention,
[00:04:27] when the window sills are quiet,
[00:04:30] late at night, awake,
[00:04:33] he does like to wonder.
[00:04:37] (Applause)
