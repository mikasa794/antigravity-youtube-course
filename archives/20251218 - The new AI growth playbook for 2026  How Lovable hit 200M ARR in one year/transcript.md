[00:00:00] You're ahead of growth at Lovable on
[00:00:01] track to be the fastest or one of the
[00:00:04] fastest growing companies in history.
[00:00:06] >> We're over 200 million in AR at this
[00:00:08] point. We're 100 people large. The pace
[00:00:10] here is insane.
[00:00:11] >> You said that you've had to throw out
[00:00:13] most of your growth playbook.
[00:00:14] >> I feel like only 30 to 40% of what I've
[00:00:17] learned in the last 15 to 20 years of
[00:00:19] being in growth transfers here because
[00:00:21] we just need to invest in such bigger
[00:00:23] bets and innovate and create new growth
[00:00:25] loops here. Everybody and their mother
[00:00:27] is starting a vibe coding business
[00:00:29] nowadays and we need to figure out how
[00:00:31] to be ahead of them. And to be ahead of
[00:00:33] them is not optimization of the problem.
[00:00:35] It's reinvention of the solution. I just
[00:00:37] feel like I usually spend maybe 5%
[00:00:40] innovating on growth in my previous
[00:00:42] roles. Right now I'm spending 95%
[00:00:45] innovating on growth and only 5% on
[00:00:47] optimization.
[00:00:48] >> What do you find is actually moving the
[00:00:50] needle? One of our biggest strategy is
[00:00:52] building in public and it's coupled with
[00:00:55] employee socials, founder le socials and
[00:00:57] another one is giving your product away
[00:00:59] a lot. This is part of our growth secret
[00:01:02] sauce. You have to remove the barrier of
[00:01:05] entry. If somebody one of our users
[00:01:06] stands up and say hey I'm going to have
[00:01:09] a hackathon at my work unlovable. Can
[00:01:11] you give us some free credits to play
[00:01:14] with? Why would we prevent a person who
[00:01:16] wants to do all of the marketing and
[00:01:18] activating for us from using us? We're
[00:01:21] like, take it. How much do you need?
[00:01:22] >> The trick is get more people to try it.
[00:01:24] Just ship things you can talk about.
[00:01:25] >> The only way to create a word of mouth
[00:01:27] loop is just to blow their socks off.
[00:01:30] >> Today, my guest is Elena Vera, head of
[00:01:33] growth at Lovable. In under one year
[00:01:35] after launching with fewer than 100
[00:01:37] people, Lovable hit 200 million ARR,
[00:01:41] which is one of, if not the fastest ramp
[00:01:44] to 200 million AR R in history, and
[00:01:46] growth is still accelerating. They've
[00:01:48] also recently raised a series B at a $6
[00:01:51] billion valuation. So, with that,
[00:01:53] there's a lot to learn about what
[00:01:55] Lovable has figured out about growth.
[00:01:57] This is Elena's fourth visit to the
[00:01:59] podcast, A Record. She is my favorite
[00:02:01] growth mind. And in our conversation, we
[00:02:04] talk about how the growth playbook has
[00:02:06] fundamentally changed for AI companies.
[00:02:08] What works now, what no longer works,
[00:02:10] and what has surprised her most about
[00:02:12] how Lovable grows. She also shares her
[00:02:14] advice about whether working at an AI
[00:02:16] company is right for you, some
[00:02:18] incredibly interesting insights into
[00:02:20] lovable secret sauce for growth, the
[00:02:22] unique ways they operate internally,
[00:02:24] their approach to building minimal
[00:02:25] lovable products, also how they hire,
[00:02:28] and also how product market fit as a
[00:02:30] concept is no longer what it used to be,
[00:02:32] and how every company basically has to
[00:02:34] recapture product market fit every 3
[00:02:36] months. This episode is incredibly
[00:02:38] tactical, and you will leave this
[00:02:39] conversation smarter on so many levels.

[00:03:13] Here's a puzzle for you. What do OpenAI,
[00:03:16] Cursor, Perplexity, Versel, Platt, and
[00:03:18] hundreds of other winning companies have
[00:03:20] in common? The answer is they're all
[00:03:22] powered by today's sponsor, Work OS. If
[00:03:25] you're building software for

[00:05:19] Elena, thank you so much for being here
[00:05:22] and welcome back to the podcast.
[00:05:24] >> Thank you for having me. As you know,
[00:05:27] this is uh a record fourth time back to
[00:05:30] the podcast. No one else has ever
[00:05:32] achieved this feat. I feel like you're
[00:05:34] uh you're basically my co-host now.
[00:05:35] >> I love it. Thank you for inviting me
[00:05:37] back. I'm very proud record holder in
[00:05:40] this regard.
[00:05:41] >> What I love about you coming back each
[00:05:42] time is feels like every time you come
[00:05:43] back, you're just doing something even
[00:05:45] more epic and exciting. And so these
[00:05:47] days, as we'll hear in the intro, you're
[00:05:48] head of growth at Lovable, which no big
[00:05:51] deal, on track to be uh the fastest or
[00:05:54] one of the fastest growing companies in
[00:05:56] history, uh depending on the metric that
[00:05:58] you track. Let's talk about just the
[00:06:00] scale and growth of Lovable to give
[00:06:01] people a sense of just how incredible
[00:06:02] this is. I'll share a bit of this in the
[00:06:04] intro, but just like what are some stats
[00:06:05] you can share about just how things are
[00:06:07] going at Loveable?
[00:06:08] >> So, uh we are just a little bit over one
[00:06:10] years old since we launched. Uh the
[00:06:12] company actually did exist as a GPT
[00:06:15] engineer before, but it officially
[00:06:17] launched in the third week of November
[00:06:19] last year in 2024.
[00:06:21] So uh for us, we've hit over $200
[00:06:25] million in annual recurring revenue
[00:06:27] before we even hit our one-year uh
[00:06:30] milestone since being launched, which is
[00:06:32] pretty incredible. Uleni actually have a
[00:06:34] really great um blog post on how quickly
[00:06:38] it takes for companies usually to get to
[00:06:39] their first million AR and it's usually
[00:06:42] multiple years. So this is definitely a
[00:06:45] unicorn. I don't think this is a
[00:06:47] standard. There's couple of things that
[00:06:50] um account for it and we can talk about
[00:06:52] it and the growth is only accelerating.
[00:06:54] So it's compounding which is great
[00:06:55] because we had our 100 million in end of
[00:06:58] July and just four months later we were
[00:07:01] at 200 million. So 7 months to well
[00:07:04] maybe 8 months to 100 million another 4
[00:07:07] months to get to 200 million. And from
[00:07:10] uh users too we already have over 8
[00:07:12] million users um that have tried
[00:07:14] lovable. We have as you can imagine to
[00:07:16] feed that 200 million hundreds of
[00:07:18] thousands of paid subscribers as well
[00:07:21] that are paying for us. Uh so things are
[00:07:24] things are going great and we'll talk
[00:07:26] about why.
[00:07:27] >> Okay. Absurd. I think people are getting
[00:07:29] used to these insane numbers and not
[00:07:31] long ago is like okay if you hit a
[00:07:33] million ARR in a year you're doing
[00:07:35] pretty well.
[00:07:36] >> Yeah. Yeah. I think it's still you're
[00:07:38] doing pretty well if you have a million
[00:07:40] AR in one year. This is uh this is one
[00:07:44] of the once in a lifetime type of
[00:07:46] companies and the category the way that
[00:07:48] it's evolving. So I want to make sure
[00:07:50] that people don't also set this as a
[00:07:52] benchmark for success because it should
[00:07:54] never be and in some categories it might
[00:07:57] be even faster um as we continue
[00:07:59] evolving technology but I don't think
[00:08:02] that it's realistic to expect it um out
[00:08:05] of your business that you're starting
[00:08:07] right now.
[00:08:08] >> That is such an important point you're
[00:08:09] making there. It's so discouraging to
[00:08:12] founders to hear this these stories of
[00:08:14] getting 200 million not and again this
[00:08:16] is ARR. There's a lot of companies,
[00:08:19] especially in the data labeling space,
[00:08:20] I've had them all on the podcast that
[00:08:22] are uh very fast growing, but they're
[00:08:24] not recurring revenue. There's also they
[00:08:26] pay out their people to do this data
[00:08:28] labeling. So, the revenue numbers there
[00:08:30] don't really equate like recurring $200
[00:08:33] million a year is absurd.
[00:08:36] >> Yeah, it is. It is absurd. I really want
[00:08:39] to make sure that people understand as
[00:08:41] we go through this episode as to why
[00:08:43] it's happening because part of it is
[00:08:45] unlovable, part of it is just in the
[00:08:46] market and and how it's moving. So when
[00:08:49] you're setting yourself as a benchmark
[00:08:51] uh so you know which benchmarks you
[00:08:52] actually to use and whether lovable is
[00:08:54] the benchmark that you should be using.
[00:08:56] >> Cool. I'm going to get into that next.
[00:08:57] Last question just I want to see what
[00:08:59] you can share here. A lot of people look
[00:09:01] at these numbers. A lot of people are
[00:09:03] very skeptical. These are lasting
[00:09:05] durable numbers. Like who are these
[00:09:07] people? How is there $200 million being
[00:09:09] spent on lovable? Anything you can amp
[00:09:12] just like give people confidence. This
[00:09:13] is real. This is going to last. This is
[00:09:16] a really durable business.
[00:09:18] >> Well, I saw Stripe receipts. So, it is
[00:09:21] real as far as I'm concerned. Um, unless
[00:09:23] Stripe dashboard is lying to us, but it
[00:09:25] is money getting deposited in our bank
[00:09:27] account. But, uh, let's talk about who's
[00:09:30] actually contributing to that number. We
[00:09:32] do have a really large use case of
[00:09:34] people uh, starting their own companies
[00:09:36] on lovable. So we call it a founder use
[00:09:38] case where somebody that is nontechnical
[00:09:40] that has never been able to code or
[00:09:42] create a piece of software is now able
[00:09:44] to come in and actually build an app
[00:09:46] completely from scratch and uh some of
[00:09:48] them are already monetizing it some of
[00:09:50] it just using it for lead genen for
[00:09:52] other services or uh some physical goods
[00:09:55] for example that they're uh that they're
[00:09:56] selling. Some of them are just still
[00:09:58] building and uh we monetize on the act
[00:10:01] of building. So that progression of like
[00:10:03] building up to your product market fit
[00:10:05] takes quite a bit of time. And even with
[00:10:07] lovable, we're so much more efficient
[00:10:09] and effective compared to hiring an
[00:10:12] engineer uh in terms of the price. But
[00:10:15] um it still takes time. Uh so we have a
[00:10:17] lot of founders uh whether it's B2C, whe
[00:10:20] there's B2B, so consumer products,
[00:10:22] business products, e-commerce, um
[00:10:24] whatever it is. But on the other side,
[00:10:25] we have a lot of employees within
[00:10:27] companies using lovable as well. Uh
[00:10:29] where they're building internal tools or
[00:10:31] they're building prototypes, they're
[00:10:33] building landing pages. So uh that is
[00:10:36] another use case that is very relevant
[00:10:38] and quite uh efficient for us. But then
[00:10:41] there is a hype and discovery that is
[00:10:43] happening as well because uh when I
[00:10:46] think about software I think about it. I
[00:10:48] talked to John Cuddler actually and he
[00:10:50] gave me this framework that is like
[00:10:52] completely stuck in my mind of software
[00:10:54] always goes through capabilities stage
[00:10:56] first like what is possible uh to
[00:10:59] actually create with this then it needs
[00:11:01] to transition into value of how is it
[00:11:03] that am I going to get value out of this
[00:11:04] and then you can start thinking about
[00:11:06] scaling it uh of which aspects of my
[00:11:08] life and my work uh can this actually go
[00:11:11] in and we're right now very much in the
[00:11:13] capability stage with vibe coding
[00:11:14] because everybody's just exploring what
[00:11:16] can I do and And the beautiful thing
[00:11:18] here is that what you can do changes
[00:11:21] every month to three months. So, uh you
[00:11:23] constantly need to come back and you
[00:11:25] need to see what has changed. So, a lot
[00:11:26] of people use it for personal reasons.
[00:11:29] Um they I build myself uh apps, tutoring
[00:11:32] apps for my kid. So, he has to answer
[00:11:35] questions in order to get some screen
[00:11:36] time accumulated for him. I build my own
[00:11:39] portfolio. I see people doing wonderful
[00:11:42] things. My favorite story that I always
[00:11:44] say, uh there's this um man that created
[00:11:47] a proposal on lovable. So his fiance had
[00:11:50] to answer questions and like she had to
[00:11:52] complete this game and then at the end
[00:11:54] there was like this big reveal and he
[00:11:55] proposed to her. But people just unlock
[00:11:58] the most creative things that they build
[00:12:00] on lovable and that's where the revenue
[00:12:02] is coming from. the one piece that is
[00:12:04] working very well for us in terms of how
[00:12:06] our monetization model is set up and how
[00:12:08] it interjects with your activation
[00:12:10] moment which we can also cover but that
[00:12:13] is what's driving um that um both
[00:12:15] conversion and retention rates.
[00:12:17] >> Let me ask you one question that's on
[00:12:18] people's minds I imagine as you talk
[00:12:20] about this just what is what is
[00:12:21] retention look like? Yeah. So retention
[00:12:24] uh really I look at it in two ways. Uh
[00:12:26] retention that it comes as a subscriber
[00:12:28] retention. Uh so how much pay
[00:12:31] subscribers do we get and how many of
[00:12:33] them are we capable of renewing. There's
[00:12:35] also very important aspect of it is how
[00:12:36] many of them can we expand because if
[00:12:38] you can get positive or above 100% net
[00:12:41] dollar retention which is super
[00:12:42] important metric for investors. If you
[00:12:44] don't know about net dollar retention
[00:12:46] please read it up. That's like a
[00:12:47] superpower to get bigger multiple. if
[00:12:49] you can show um NDR that is over 100 and
[00:12:52] then there's actually engagement
[00:12:53] retention as well because uh that is the
[00:12:55] leading indicator for how your paid
[00:12:58] retention is going to look like for paid
[00:13:00] retention um I know there's a so much on
[00:13:03] the market of oh this is a high product
[00:13:06] and um it just it's a leaky bucket and
[00:13:08] it has really high churn rates although
[00:13:11] um I'm not I shouldn't share it's not
[00:13:13] public numbers for us to share actual
[00:13:15] retention however what I can say it's on
[00:13:17] par with benchmarks of other B2B SAS
[00:13:20] products that I've ever worked at and I
[00:13:22] worked with Miro, Dropbox, uh Survey
[00:13:24] Monkey, Netifi, um Amplitude and others.
[00:13:28] So, are we are we absolutely crushing
[00:13:31] with paid retention? Um no, are we where
[00:13:34] most of the other companies are? Yes.
[00:13:37] Our NDR is quite good because when
[00:13:39] people build, they want to buy more
[00:13:40] credits to bill. So, uh, we're seeing
[00:13:42] really good, uh, revenue retention, but
[00:13:44] we're honestly more focused right now on
[00:13:46] engagement retention than even paid
[00:13:48] retention because our northstar is just
[00:13:51] to get as much usage as possible. And,
[00:13:54] uh, we will fix and tune our
[00:13:55] monetization model afterwards. So,
[00:13:58] engagement retention, I would say, is a
[00:14:00] by far bigger priority focus for us at
[00:14:03] the moment.
[00:14:04] >> That is incredibly uh, interesting and
[00:14:06] optimistic to hear because of the growth
[00:14:08] rate. Uh rarely is growth rate this high
[00:14:11] and retention is on par with great
[00:14:14] companies.
[00:14:15] >> Yeah. And I'll just say too which is a
[00:14:17] little bit maybe counterintuitive to
[00:14:19] would be to a lot of companies we don't
[00:14:22] optimize for revenue at all. In fact
[00:14:24] internally we have a lot of discussions
[00:14:26] about how can we give more products
[00:14:29] away. How can we uh reduce our revenue
[00:14:32] growth rate by just getting more paid
[00:14:35] subscribers, more users using lovable to
[00:14:37] just get bigger share of the market. So
[00:14:40] our revenue is an outcome of us just
[00:14:43] trying to get more people through the
[00:14:45] door, not us trying to optimize for
[00:14:48] revenue per user or to get them to
[00:14:50] monetize at the higher rate. So there's
[00:14:52] like a very interesting path here where
[00:14:54] by actually focusing on the inputs like
[00:14:56] you should, it translates to a good
[00:14:58] output. But we don't look at that output
[00:15:00] as something that we're trying to grow.
[00:15:02] >> Let's talk about growth. Let's talk
[00:15:04] about what you've learned about growth
[00:15:05] in this space. You had this post online
[00:15:08] where you said that you've had to throw
[00:15:09] out most of your growth playbook.
[00:15:11] >> This is a huge deal. You've led growth a
[00:15:13] lot of really successful companies.
[00:15:15] >> Lovable is growing incredibly well. Uh
[00:15:17] this tells me there's a lot we can learn
[00:15:19] from what you've seen. So tell us what
[00:15:22] you're seeing, what's still working,
[00:15:23] what's not working, what you've uh
[00:15:25] learned about what it takes to drive
[00:15:26] growth at a company like Lovable. Yeah,
[00:15:28] I would say that in any other role that
[00:15:30] I've come into before, uh I felt
[00:15:34] confident in about 80% of the patterns
[00:15:37] that I can bring to that role. Meaning
[00:15:39] that I can identify inputs, understand
[00:15:41] which framework kind of applies. I know
[00:15:44] a bunch of examples that fit in within
[00:15:46] that framework. So we just need to
[00:15:47] localize a solution and push and it was
[00:15:49] quite productive in terms of getting a
[00:15:51] company those additional acquisition,
[00:15:54] conversion, engagement, monetization
[00:15:56] rates. So um I I felt very repetitive in
[00:16:00] a way um after some time because I feel
[00:16:02] like I'm just coming in and copy pasting
[00:16:04] copy pasting and although every single
[00:16:05] company loves to say that they have
[00:16:07] unique problems at the end of the day
[00:16:08] all of the problems were very similar
[00:16:10] and I felt like I was like doing the
[00:16:12] same job over and over again when I
[00:16:14] started at lovable the one thing to me
[00:16:15] that was very clear is that uh this
[00:16:18] company was growing like crazy before I
[00:16:21] joined. So I want to make sure that
[00:16:23] there's not that much value on what I
[00:16:25] have even added to date because this
[00:16:27] company is on a tear and yes we're
[00:16:30] rounding the edges to and removing
[00:16:32] barriers for growth. Uh so we're not
[00:16:35] standing in our own way but uh there's
[00:16:37] something more magical happening here
[00:16:39] that is not a pattern that I've ever
[00:16:42] seen before. It's not a framework that I
[00:16:44] can even conceptualize um in my head.
[00:16:47] And plus, it's a new category that I've
[00:16:49] never seen or I've never been in a
[00:16:52] company that is in a new emerging
[00:16:54] category that hits fastmoving waters so
[00:16:57] quickly. And that's the difference
[00:16:59] because when you're usually trying to
[00:17:01] create a new category, it takes years. I
[00:17:03] know it's every marketer's dream to
[00:17:05] create a new category, but it takes
[00:17:07] decades often to like really to really
[00:17:09] get that much hype and adoption around
[00:17:11] it. Versus with Vibe coding, this has
[00:17:14] seemed to have happened really quickly.
[00:17:16] It's like it's hit the nerve with the
[00:17:17] market. So yes, we're at the right
[00:17:20] place, we're at the right time, but
[00:17:21] we're also in really fastm moving waters
[00:17:24] and um the demand that is coming to us
[00:17:26] like we need to capture it mostly. We
[00:17:28] don't need to generate a lot of it yet.
[00:17:31] But at the same time, it comes with a
[00:17:32] really big downfalls of we're not in
[00:17:34] control of a lot of our growth. I mean,
[00:17:36] let's be honest about it. There's so
[00:17:38] much incredible word of mouth that is
[00:17:40] happening and we're trying to grow that
[00:17:42] but uh to enable as much of that as
[00:17:44] possible but um it's the company is
[00:17:47] moving. We're just like hanging on to it
[00:17:50] as fast as possible and making sure that
[00:17:53] the we're like not going to hit a wall
[00:17:55] so to speak in front of us and that the
[00:17:58] wheels are greased and that all of the
[00:18:00] pieces are in place. like your race car
[00:18:02] framework uh that you have as well that
[00:18:04] like we're we're really just putting a
[00:18:06] lot of oil into it and um figuring out
[00:18:09] what is our engine actually going to be
[00:18:11] that is going to take us forward. But uh
[00:18:14] when I'm thinking about the patterns
[00:18:16] here and what I have to unlearn, I feel
[00:18:18] like only 30 to 40% of what I've learned
[00:18:21] in the last 15 to 20 years of being in
[00:18:23] growth transfers here. And uh some of it
[00:18:26] is very straightforward. Okay, this is
[00:18:28] how you're going to do paid marketing.
[00:18:30] this is how you're going to do some of
[00:18:31] the habitual retention. Here's the free
[00:18:33] to pay maybe monetization uh frameworks
[00:18:36] that still stand. But the rest of it um
[00:18:40] seriously doesn't feel like it even
[00:18:41] matters anymore because we just need to
[00:18:44] invest in such bigger bets and innovate
[00:18:46] and create new growth loops here as
[00:18:49] opposed to trying to optimize it uh to
[00:18:51] the moon and be and beyond uh which
[00:18:53] would I usually be focused on in a scale
[00:18:56] business like this.
[00:18:57] >> Let's follow those threads. So what is
[00:18:58] it that no longer is worth it in this
[00:19:00] bucket of just like let's not spend any
[00:19:02] time on this thing and then what do you
[00:19:04] find is actually moving the needle
[00:19:06] >> not worth it in growth uh most of the
[00:19:09] people spend most of the time optimizing
[00:19:12] existing user journeys. So, uh, you
[00:19:15] already have maybe some of your growth
[00:19:17] loops that you understand that you try
[00:19:18] to optimize or you just know, hey,
[00:19:20] there's big drop offs from acquisition
[00:19:22] to activation. Let me go figure out how
[00:19:24] to I can tweak the dials to get it done.
[00:19:27] Here, what I find is that um,
[00:19:29] optimizations are just not worth our
[00:19:31] time. So, a lot of the times my growth
[00:19:34] team actually ends up working on new
[00:19:35] features or just standing up new growth
[00:19:37] loops one after another. And yes, there
[00:19:40] is of of course the saying of like more
[00:19:42] growth loops does not mean more growth.
[00:19:45] But at the same time, the market is
[00:19:47] moving so quickly. You need to stand up
[00:19:50] a bunch of initiatives uh to capture it
[00:19:52] because it's perishable or we also have
[00:19:55] so much competition. We're not alone
[00:19:57] here. So we can't ignore that there's
[00:20:01] everybody in their mother is starting a
[00:20:02] VIP coding business nowadays and we need
[00:20:05] to figure out how to be ahead of them.
[00:20:06] and to be ahead of them is not
[00:20:08] optimization of the problem. It's
[00:20:10] reinvention of the solution. So I just
[00:20:13] feel like I usually spend maybe 5% maybe
[00:20:16] 10% if I'm lucky innovating on growth in
[00:20:19] my roles uh in my previous roles. Right
[00:20:22] now I'm spending 95% innovating on
[00:20:24] growth and only 5% on optimization. And
[00:20:27] most of my frameworks are on
[00:20:29] optimization because it's really hard to
[00:20:31] come up with frameworks for innovation
[00:20:33] because by default they're by definition
[00:20:37] they're innovative.
[00:20:38] >> What I'm hearing here is uh new features
[00:20:40] launching new features, new products as
[00:20:42] one of the bigger growth levers versus
[00:20:44] like you have a bunch of cool stuff make
[00:20:46] it more make it easier to use increase
[00:20:48] activation reduce friction things like
[00:20:50] that.
[00:20:51] >> Yeah. And for example, um we on growth
[00:20:54] team launched uh integration with
[00:20:56] Shopify to enable e-commerce use case
[00:20:59] because we're like hey there's already
[00:21:01] people trying to come in and do it and
[00:21:03] Shopify was open for integration with
[00:21:05] us. Let's go lean into it so people can
[00:21:08] vibe code their storefronts. Uh that
[00:21:10] came out of growth that usually would
[00:21:12] never come out of growth. like why would
[00:21:13] growth team ever invest into a core
[00:21:15] product integration or we um enable
[00:21:18] voice mode for people so they can
[00:21:20] actually chat with lovable using their
[00:21:21] voice as opposed to only having type and
[00:21:24] um that's also it's a feature it's a
[00:21:26] core product feature but we're like hey
[00:21:28] it's going to help people to converse
[00:21:29] with lovable more it's going to increase
[00:21:31] the engagement one area that we've spent
[00:21:33] very little time in is activation
[00:21:35] because usually I spend majority of my
[00:21:37] time in activation because there's so
[00:21:39] many awareness things that need to
[00:21:42] happened and uh so many things that uh
[00:21:45] we we need to like smooth out experience
[00:21:48] for the users in order for them to get
[00:21:50] through that setup moment to aha moment
[00:21:52] to that habit loop and here you're just
[00:21:54] interacting with agent. So uh we at the
[00:21:57] beginning were like the agent team that
[00:22:00] we have here is working a lot on it like
[00:22:01] why would we go in there and and do
[00:22:04] anything is like our core team is
[00:22:05] responsible for activation. Now we're
[00:22:07] starting to move into doing agent work
[00:22:09] ourselves. So all of a sudden growth
[00:22:11] team is not just doing product surfaces
[00:22:14] now we're doing agentic workflows um and
[00:22:17] codifying agent instructions in order
[00:22:20] for customers to activate better. So the
[00:22:22] work fundamentally I feel like has
[00:22:24] gotten deeper into product and deeper
[00:22:27] into actual core product functionality
[00:22:30] as opposed to just being a smoothing
[00:22:32] surface on the outer layers.
[00:22:34] >> Okay, that is also a very big deal.
[00:22:36] Every growth person that's ever been on
[00:22:38] this podcast, including you, always
[00:22:39] talks about the power of activation.
[00:22:41] Just the how much opportunity there is
[00:22:43] constant to get people to this aha
[00:22:45] moment, realize how the value of this
[00:22:47] product that increases retention,
[00:22:48] increases everything. And what you're
[00:22:50] saying here is you barely spend any time
[00:22:52] on activation because in a company like
[00:22:55] Lovable, there's a prompt. You give it
[00:22:57] what you want, it generates a thing, and
[00:22:59] that's basically all it is. And so the
[00:23:01] impact is to make that agent better at
[00:23:04] that thing versus microoptimize every
[00:23:06] step.
[00:23:06] >> And our agent team spends night and day
[00:23:10] thinking about it. So I've never been at
[00:23:12] the company where core team thinks so
[00:23:14] much about activation, think so much
[00:23:16] about that first generation, thinks so
[00:23:18] much about reaching aha moment. So it's
[00:23:21] more weaved in into DNA of the overall
[00:23:23] company which takes the pressure off of
[00:23:26] me to only have to focus on it because
[00:23:28] otherwise yeah I would be in that in
[00:23:30] that experience all the time but I feel
[00:23:32] a lot more at ease because everybody's
[00:23:34] thinking about it and everybody's
[00:23:37] working on making agent better and agent
[00:23:40] the beauty of it is it doesn't matter if
[00:23:41] it's actually first generation or if
[00:23:43] it's your nth generation it just needs
[00:23:45] to be a better generation agent needs to
[00:23:47] understand your intent better and think
[00:23:49] and reason behind behind it. So it like
[00:23:51] improves the entire life cycle
[00:23:53] immediately as opposed to having to only
[00:23:56] work on that first experience per se.
[00:23:59] >> And what you're not saying is don't care
[00:24:01] about that experience. It's the team
[00:24:03] building that is already obsessed with
[00:24:05] making that activation experience
[00:24:07] better.
[00:24:08] >> And I I love that because I that's the
[00:24:10] core product functionality at this
[00:24:12] point. And before uh people would spend
[00:24:16] more time building deeper features or
[00:24:18] deeper use cases or trying to um improve
[00:24:22] some platform functionality and now the
[00:24:24] core team they're obsessed about that
[00:24:26] first experience because that is core
[00:24:28] product.
[00:24:29] >> Another lever that I've noticed
[00:24:31] especially with lovable and I'm seeing
[00:24:32] it more and more in social media is just
[00:24:34] founders telling you what's going on. I
[00:24:36] think this connects really deeply with
[00:24:38] the new features. Launch new features.
[00:24:39] Say Anton is just like hey check out
[00:24:41] this cool new thing. Check out our
[00:24:42] growth numbers. Is that a big growth
[00:24:44] lever too?
[00:24:45] >> Yeah. So, one of our biggest strategy is
[00:24:49] uh building in public. Uh building in
[00:24:52] public and it's coupled with employee
[00:24:54] socials, founder socials for sure. Uh
[00:24:58] this is difficult for larger companies,
[00:25:00] but when you're smaller and you still
[00:25:02] have a little bit more narrative control
[00:25:05] uh with uh with everybody on your team,
[00:25:07] plus you have so much more trust within
[00:25:09] your organization of whether people are
[00:25:11] going to say the right things because
[00:25:12] they understand what actually has
[00:25:14] happened. Uh that ability to just really
[00:25:18] quickly deliver the message to the
[00:25:19] market becomes really important. Now we
[00:25:21] still do big launches. So we still have
[00:25:24] everything tiered into tier three, tier
[00:25:26] one. Like tier ones are going to happen
[00:25:28] as like big moments that we're going to
[00:25:30] really rally as a company behind and
[00:25:32] it's going to be something that um is
[00:25:35] meant to step function change our
[00:25:36] product market fit and uh we're going to
[00:25:39] do a bunch of activities behind it. But
[00:25:40] at the same time, what's really
[00:25:42] important to us is to maintain noise in
[00:25:45] the market. And that noise in the market
[00:25:47] happens by us shipping every day, every
[00:25:50] other day, multiple times per day and
[00:25:53] just talking about it constantly.
[00:25:55] Interestingly enough, it's actually
[00:25:57] works as fantastic resurrection strategy
[00:25:59] because people like, "Oh, there's more
[00:26:01] things here. Like, I need to go check it
[00:26:02] out." It also works as great
[00:26:04] re-engagement strategy. So, instead of
[00:26:06] sending newsletters to say like, "Here's
[00:26:08] the market trends or here's the user
[00:26:09] stories." Like, people are like
[00:26:10] literally logging into their social to
[00:26:13] see like, "Okay, what has lovable
[00:26:14] shipped now?" like what what what is the
[00:26:16] change? So, it's interesting to them to
[00:26:18] see because from the time that they
[00:26:20] voice their opinion on what needs to
[00:26:21] happen to actual delivery is so short.
[00:26:24] So, they feel heard and they are heard
[00:26:26] because that's how we uh prioritize all
[00:26:29] of the things that we're shipping. But,
[00:26:30] it's interesting because
[00:26:32] I've never been in a company that tries
[00:26:35] to maintain so much just shipping
[00:26:37] velocity to maintain certain amount of
[00:26:40] noise that it feels like the product is
[00:26:42] alive. it's changing every single week.
[00:26:45] And then there's like these big
[00:26:46] amplifications, turbo boosts so to speak
[00:26:48] in the race car model uh that then go
[00:26:51] out and they fundamentally create a step
[00:26:54] function change in that product market
[00:26:56] fit as a whole. And uh that is a
[00:26:59] retention strategy I can get behind any
[00:27:01] day and all day. I only hope that we can
[00:27:04] maintain it as we continue scaling.
[00:27:06] >> Sounds stressful. This reminds me I had
[00:27:10] Garav. He is the CEO of uh Mirage used
[00:27:13] to be called Captions which is a really
[00:27:15] successful AI video company startup and
[00:27:17] they have a policy of you ship a a
[00:27:20] marketable feature every week.
[00:27:22] >> That's how their company operates and
[00:27:25] it's the same thing is just ship things
[00:27:26] you can talk about.
[00:27:27] >> Velocity of shipping is our number one
[00:27:30] core value in development team. So we do
[00:27:32] anything and everything to just keep it
[00:27:34] going up up up and um into the right.
[00:27:37] And by the way, this is also means that
[00:27:39] everybody is a little has a little bit
[00:27:40] of marketer within them. This is uh we
[00:27:42] have very lean product organization. We
[00:27:44] actually lean on our engineers uh to do
[00:27:46] a lot of product work. We call them
[00:27:48] product engineers. Uh and uh they have
[00:27:51] to go and they have to announce the
[00:27:54] thing that they've shipped. It doesn't
[00:27:55] just funnel through marketing. So
[00:27:57] there's a lot of uh autonomy, a lot of
[00:27:59] agency that needs to happen with this
[00:28:01] with this type of velocity because
[00:28:03] marketing team otherwise you have to
[00:28:05] have like enormous marketing team to
[00:28:06] staff that. So it has to come with some
[00:28:09] roles and responsibilities uh
[00:28:11] redefinition on the team as well.
[00:28:13] >> Let's talk about marketing. That's
[00:28:14] something else you've written about is
[00:28:15] just marketing is changing in a big way
[00:28:17] their role in growth. How does marketing
[00:28:19] play a role in all of this? On one side,
[00:28:22] marketing channels are changing. On the
[00:28:24] other side, marketing's involvement into
[00:28:26] everything that product does is
[00:28:28] changing. And then number three, I think
[00:28:30] even marketing organizations in terms of
[00:28:32] where they're hired the most um are
[00:28:34] changing as a result as well. So I'll
[00:28:36] talk about second one first just because
[00:28:38] we just talked about shipping and that
[00:28:40] is um yeah you still have your product
[00:28:42] marketers, you still have your channel
[00:28:44] managers um but they focus more on the
[00:28:46] big things and the narratives although
[00:28:49] it's difficult because the narrative
[00:28:50] even changes all the time as these
[00:28:52] functionalities come through. Usually
[00:28:55] you can come up with the positioning and
[00:28:57] messaging and you can have it for years
[00:28:59] and and create all of the campaigns
[00:29:01] around it. Now you have it for three
[00:29:02] months and then the product changes. So
[00:29:05] like the cycles here are really uh
[00:29:07] really short and uh for smaller changes
[00:29:10] because cycles are so short they spend
[00:29:12] so much time actually focusing on it as
[00:29:14] they should that some of these smaller
[00:29:15] changes just cannot be supported by
[00:29:17] marketing. You have to delegate it to
[00:29:19] your product and engineering team to do
[00:29:21] their own marketing because otherwise
[00:29:23] again you're going to have to have
[00:29:24] enormous marketing team in order to
[00:29:26] support it all. But at the same time,
[00:29:28] channels in which marketing right now
[00:29:30] works I think are changing quite a bit
[00:29:32] and um not enough people I feel like are
[00:29:34] freaking out and talking about it as
[00:29:36] opposed to like moving just in the same
[00:29:38] direction over and over again. And the
[00:29:40] changes that I'm seeing is that it is
[00:29:43] very has been very clear to me that when
[00:29:46] you're talking about organic strategy,
[00:29:47] if you marketing organic strategy, if
[00:29:49] you asked me that five years ago, I
[00:29:52] would have said that's SEO. It's search
[00:29:54] engine optimization. go on Google.
[00:29:56] That's your organic marketing strategy.
[00:29:58] If you ask me what's the organic
[00:30:00] marketing strategy right now, to me,
[00:30:01] it's all about social, which is what is
[00:30:04] my CEO posting? What is my team posting?
[00:30:06] What is my LinkedIn? What is my creator
[00:30:09] economy doing in influencer marketing?
[00:30:12] And um across all of the social
[00:30:14] platforms, that is my organic, which is
[00:30:16] that one's kind of paid to be fair, but
[00:30:18] when I think about organic, there is
[00:30:19] still a lot of that word of mouth. What
[00:30:21] are my users posting on social? What are
[00:30:23] they talking about it? what are they uh
[00:30:25] what are they sharing which is like a
[00:30:27] mind shift because I've been always
[00:30:29] especially in B2B so focused on search
[00:30:32] and now I feel like it's been completely
[00:30:34] pushed even further into consumerization
[00:30:37] territory and it has become all about
[00:30:39] social no matter how B2B you are because
[00:30:42] that's where eyeballs are at
[00:30:44] >> that is fascinating and so when you talk
[00:30:46] about socials what are you finding is
[00:30:48] most helpful is it Twitterx is it
[00:30:50] LinkedIn is it YouTube Tik Tok Instagram
[00:30:52] >> for founder socials uh O employee
[00:30:54] socials um X and LinkedIn are fantastic
[00:30:57] sources. Um especially for B2B because
[00:30:59] that's where all of the B2B people are
[00:31:02] at. But you cannot just have Chad GPT
[00:31:05] write your copy and post it. You need to
[00:31:07] show personality like there needs to be
[00:31:10] humanity uh that it goes through it. And
[00:31:13] it's not natural for everybody and it
[00:31:15] feels very awkward sometimes to start.
[00:31:17] Uh but it's important to people to see
[00:31:20] who's building the company because
[00:31:22] there's so much competition now on
[00:31:24] functionality so they can rally behind a
[00:31:27] team. So they want to have a team that
[00:31:30] they want to win and for that you need
[00:31:33] to be vulnerable. You need to be
[00:31:36] authentic obviously but you just need to
[00:31:38] be yourself. Uh so like that corporate
[00:31:41] scrubbing has to completely fall off
[00:31:43] which um is obviously going to pull in
[00:31:47] as as the company scales but at least at
[00:31:50] the beginning that is a chance to stand
[00:31:51] out and then your customers posting
[00:31:53] about you. So that word of mouth of uh
[00:31:56] really creating a product that creates
[00:32:00] something for customers that is worth
[00:32:02] talking about. It gives them stories
[00:32:05] that they want to share that feels
[00:32:07] empowering to them to tell to others
[00:32:10] like they're unlocking a secret like
[00:32:12] they feel proud of what they have
[00:32:13] created which what we focus a lot on
[00:32:16] lovable on to have that feeling of oh my
[00:32:18] gosh I have superpowers now and I can't
[00:32:20] wait to tell others I cannot wait to
[00:32:23] show others what is happening so on both
[00:32:26] of those sides to me that is very much
[00:32:28] organic um if you're in a consumer then
[00:32:30] Instagram Tik Tok um are very much a go
[00:32:33] as well.
[00:32:34] >> So here it's uh the CEO clearly is an
[00:32:37] important uh variable in this them in
[00:32:39] this case Anton just tweeting here's
[00:32:41] what's going on lovable here's how fast
[00:32:42] it's growing here's some we've learned
[00:32:44] >> uh we had the CEO of gamma uh on
[00:32:46] recently Grant and he's exactly the same
[00:32:48] thing just sharing a bunch of lessons
[00:32:50] journey building in public a big part of
[00:32:51] the growth lever and your point here is
[00:32:53] okay so it's the co but then it's also
[00:32:55] how do you get your customers to share
[00:32:56] things on socials and then there's a
[00:32:59] paid uh influencer sort of component
[00:33:01] >> yes uh the customer is difficult one,
[00:33:03] that's a word of mouth loop that you
[00:33:05] need to stand up. The only way to create
[00:33:07] a word of mouth loop is just to blow
[00:33:09] their socks off uh when they actually
[00:33:12] experience your product. We have a
[00:33:14] really almost unfair advantage because
[00:33:16] our product is called lovable. So by
[00:33:19] default, we're trying to create an
[00:33:20] absolute lovable experiences. Like that
[00:33:23] is a mentality internally. If it's not
[00:33:25] lovable, we're not going to ship it. So
[00:33:28] uh and the best way to fix a bug at
[00:33:30] lovable is to say this is not lovable.
[00:33:32] like when everybody's just like jumps on
[00:33:34] it. Uh to fix it right there and then
[00:33:36] sprints, no sprints, it doesn't matter.
[00:33:38] It's getting fixed right now. So, uh
[00:33:40] from that perspective, we kind of have
[00:33:42] that culture already embedded as part of
[00:33:45] our brand and it's part of our name,
[00:33:46] which helps us a lot. But that's the
[00:33:49] point is that you feel that brand
[00:33:50] through every interaction. Uh I talk to
[00:33:52] my designer all the time. How can we add
[00:33:54] more love marks into the product? How
[00:33:56] can we prioritize more unique
[00:33:58] interactions? the little elements that
[00:34:00] make up that that feeling of this
[00:34:03] product is speaking to me. It's like it
[00:34:04] feels something like that is unique. It
[00:34:06] has personality uh behind it. So we put
[00:34:09] all of the brand work actually into our
[00:34:11] product. When you think about lovable
[00:34:14] think people think about a brand but we
[00:34:16] don't have a brand marketing team yet.
[00:34:18] So it's all just through product
[00:34:19] interactions and some of those building
[00:34:22] and public moments of the people behind
[00:34:25] uh those product interactions. Um that
[00:34:27] is our strategy. And then there's
[00:34:28] influencer marketing. Interestingly
[00:34:30] enough, influencer marketing is 10 times
[00:34:32] bigger for us than paid social. So yeah,
[00:34:35] we do some paid social as well. Um, and
[00:34:37] it's working decently. It's quite
[00:34:39] expensive from payback period. Um, we're
[00:34:42] still optimizing it. As I said, we're
[00:34:43] pretty early on in all of these
[00:34:45] channels, but influencer marketing is
[00:34:47] something that has worked uh from the
[00:34:48] beginning. a lovable and uh reason
[00:34:51] behind it is that influencer marketing
[00:34:53] especially on the socials it gives you
[00:34:55] an opportunity to have a little video
[00:34:57] and interaction and lovable is all about
[00:34:59] seeing like oh my gosh this is what I
[00:35:01] can do and uh this is possible so that
[00:35:05] drives people to go and try it
[00:35:06] themselves so that's why social works
[00:35:08] very well for us because it's not really
[00:35:10] a written value proposition like nobody
[00:35:12] knows what bite coding is but you watch
[00:35:14] 10 seconds of it and you go that's new
[00:35:17] let me go give it a try
[00:35:18] >> who would have thought that a head of
[00:35:20] growth who is traditionally seen as like
[00:35:23] data metrics, spreadsheets, drive KPIs
[00:35:26] is like, okay, how do we make this more
[00:35:28] lovable? How do we add more moments of
[00:35:30] delight? I know my my my joke is like at
[00:35:33] the end of my lovable journey whenever
[00:35:36] hopefully never comes to an end, but but
[00:35:38] at the end I'll be like a growth brand
[00:35:41] person here. Here, hi, my name is Elena.
[00:35:43] I do brand now. But I I actually see it
[00:35:46] as part of growth strategy to make sure
[00:35:48] that that brand shines through every
[00:35:50] single interaction. Um and I always talk
[00:35:53] to my team about it because that is one
[00:35:56] big lever in our growth story.
[00:35:58] >> Yeah. So I think that's a really
[00:36:00] important point to highlight. The reason
[00:36:01] Lovable is growing so fast is it is a
[00:36:03] product people love. You've made
[00:36:05] something people want and the word of
[00:36:07] mouth spreads because it's something
[00:36:08] that blows people's socks off as you
[00:36:10] said. So it feels like that's the first
[00:36:12] thing you got to get right.
[00:36:13] >> Yes. Well, the first thing you have to
[00:36:15] get right is you have to be at the right
[00:36:17] place at the right time and you have to
[00:36:18] be in fastmoving waters. Like let's not
[00:36:20] discount how fast this category is
[00:36:22] exploding on its own. So this cannot
[00:36:24] happen in every single category that
[00:36:26] you're starting to build a product. But
[00:36:28] the way to stand out in the super
[00:36:30] crowded category is to create
[00:36:31] experiences that speak to people. That I
[00:36:34] think is something that a lot of people
[00:36:35] deprioritize because they still
[00:36:37] prioritize functionality over humanity
[00:36:40] within software. And I think that we're
[00:36:42] actually moving to the new era of
[00:36:44] software that needs to feel human that
[00:36:46] people want to interact with not just
[00:36:49] utility of it because cost of software
[00:36:51] is coming down so much to develop that
[00:36:55] we now can actually invest into
[00:36:57] emotional feel of that software as
[00:37:00] opposed to only just focus on creating
[00:37:02] the utility out of it. So to me it's um
[00:37:06] it's a I I I love this move because I I
[00:37:09] hate nothing more than going to software
[00:37:11] that is just like so painful to use that
[00:37:13] I lose some brain cells uh as I'm
[00:37:15] interacting with it versus software that
[00:37:17] I feel I get energy out of and for
[00:37:20] lovable for me like I cannot wait on
[00:37:22] some of the projects that I have to go
[00:37:24] and vibe code myself like that's the
[00:37:25] highlight of my day and I just like I
[00:37:28] don't I I I bring in my daughter and I'm
[00:37:30] like let's go do this like what do you
[00:37:31] think that needs to be done because I
[00:37:33] just get so energy out of doing it and
[00:37:35] uh that is the feeling you cannot create
[00:37:38] by looking at it as a utility problem.
[00:37:41] >> The way I think about it, the way what
[00:37:43] you're describing is it's almost table
[00:37:44] stakes have increased and now it's so
[00:37:47] easy to build. Now the big
[00:37:49] differentiator is experience, design,
[00:37:50] delight.
[00:37:52] >> Exactly. And it has to translate through
[00:37:54] every single interaction. So your
[00:37:56] designer has to be one of your first
[00:37:57] hires now in startups. It's not just
[00:38:00] about the the engineering so to speak
[00:38:03] utility and you have to think through
[00:38:05] every single interaction of does this
[00:38:07] communicate our brand or not.
[00:38:09] >> So along those lines I want to come back
[00:38:10] to something you talked about which is
[00:38:11] launching new features is a huge growth
[00:38:13] lever. Kind of the big question there is
[00:38:15] just how do you maintain quality and
[00:38:17] cohesiveness as all these people are
[00:38:19] empowered to ship stuff. Is there
[00:38:20] anything else there you've seen that
[00:38:22] works well to help avoid just a
[00:38:24] Frankenstein product just endless
[00:38:26] features that you want to tweet about?
[00:38:28] Yeah, one part of it is not something
[00:38:31] that you can codify, but it's the type
[00:38:33] of people that you hire that are going
[00:38:34] to go and ship these things. We at
[00:38:37] Lovable try to hire the absolute best
[00:38:39] talent available out there that we can
[00:38:41] bring in and that we can source and that
[00:38:43] we can attract uh to grow with. And what
[00:38:46] do I mean by that best talent? Um it's
[00:38:48] not that somebody who has been at really
[00:38:50] large companies or somebody that has
[00:38:51] really uh done a lot of logos or has big
[00:38:54] success stories behind them. It's
[00:38:56] somebody who is extremely passionate
[00:38:57] about their job. It's their hobby. They
[00:39:00] love to work. They have fire in their
[00:39:02] belly. This is not a paycheck for them.
[00:39:04] They want to do this for some ulterior
[00:39:07] reason. This is the biggest opportunity
[00:39:10] of their life. So this is global maxima
[00:39:13] against any other opportunities that are
[00:39:15] in front of them at the moment. So
[00:39:17] that's very important for us. We want
[00:39:19] people to come and do their absolute
[00:39:20] best work at lovable. It's very
[00:39:22] important and you can feel it in this
[00:39:24] office. People are wired up. They are so
[00:39:29] high on how can we make this better? How
[00:39:32] can we deliver more to our customers?
[00:39:34] And that's very different compared to
[00:39:37] usually how companies grow. We're like,
[00:39:39] okay, yeah, the check, check, check.
[00:39:40] They fit the skill set. Let's bring them
[00:39:42] in. But is that passion? Is that fire
[00:39:44] behind it? And then uh the second piece
[00:39:47] is that um we work really hard on just
[00:39:50] addressing what's the success here looks
[00:39:52] like? What is it that we're building?
[00:39:54] what use cases are we building for? And
[00:39:56] then because we hire these people that
[00:39:59] are so passionate about it, the other
[00:40:00] two skills, by the way, that are super
[00:40:02] important is high agency and high
[00:40:03] autonomy, I can figure out things that
[00:40:05] are tangential to me that I don't need
[00:40:08] other specialty, so to speak. Like I
[00:40:10] don't need a marketer to go launch
[00:40:12] something. I can go figure it out and I
[00:40:14] have high agency. I can go do it myself.
[00:40:16] Um I'm going to own it from all the way
[00:40:19] from start to finish. uh those are very
[00:40:21] important, something that we screen for
[00:40:22] and something that we look for in our
[00:40:24] culture and then uh you just see what
[00:40:28] you want to do is up to you. So there's
[00:40:30] very little supervision that happens on
[00:40:32] the ground. Um now we all have a goals
[00:40:35] and like some of the big launches that
[00:40:36] we're all marching towards but some of
[00:40:38] the work um that is completely up to
[00:40:41] developers up to uh marketers or
[00:40:43] whatever what is it that they want to
[00:40:44] do. So there has to be that enablement
[00:40:47] of go try things and because of our
[00:40:50] velocity if you fail it's not a big deal
[00:40:52] we'll just pivot we'll go we'll get
[00:40:54] we'll get through it we are not here to
[00:40:57] just win all the time
[00:40:59] >> on the hiring of these incredible people
[00:41:02] as we all know it's very hard to hire
[00:41:03] people these days especially the best
[00:41:05] what have you seen lovable does
[00:41:07] differently or does well that helps them
[00:41:08] recruit the best
[00:41:10] >> yes and especially recruit in Stockholm
[00:41:12] I mean the main office here is in
[00:41:14] Stockholm we're asking a lot of people
[00:41:15] to relocate uh which is a no small feat.
[00:41:18] Now some of it is um makes it easy
[00:41:20] because of how much hype we created
[00:41:22] around our product. People want to come
[00:41:24] work for us like there's um they're
[00:41:26] reaching out to us. They're saying I I
[00:41:28] love what you're doing. I want to join
[00:41:30] it. Uh so that we have a cheat code to
[00:41:33] it because like we have most of the time
[00:41:35] when we reach out to somebody they say
[00:41:37] yeah I would love to explore. So uh
[00:41:40] building that product that is highly
[00:41:42] lovable also creates a really great
[00:41:44] recruiting brand for you as well. So
[00:41:46] make sure that there like multiple
[00:41:48] benefits to that. But uh second of all
[00:41:51] we do a lot of trials uh for people. So
[00:41:54] trial work to see them in action
[00:41:56] >> a work trial to see them in action for a
[00:41:59] couple of days. We pay them as part of
[00:42:00] the work trial. We have uh some
[00:42:02] probation periods that we start people
[00:42:04] on uh because this company is not for
[00:42:06] everybody. As I start said in the
[00:42:08] podcast in in the beginning, the pace
[00:42:11] here is insane. I went on vacation uh
[00:42:14] for the first time. So I've been here
[00:42:16] for 6 months. I went on vacation um for
[00:42:19] 10 days. I came back. I felt like I
[00:42:21] needed to on board from the beginning.
[00:42:24] Like everything changed. And when I'm in
[00:42:26] it, I feel like it's an evolution. But
[00:42:29] the fact that just being gone for 10
[00:42:31] days, it feels like a complete
[00:42:32] revolution in the company. It's that
[00:42:34] pace is just not for everybody. And
[00:42:36] that's okay because I'm very firm
[00:42:38] believer that there's different cultures
[00:42:40] and different environments that the best
[00:42:42] fit for different personalities and
[00:42:43] different people. So we try to be very
[00:42:45] upfront with how things are and how
[00:42:49] chaotic they are. And we prioritize
[00:42:51] people that don't look for clarity but
[00:42:53] can create clarity out of chaos because
[00:42:57] um it is absolutely chaotic otherwise.
[00:43:00] And if we start to look for people that
[00:43:03] can explain it uh to us, that's the only
[00:43:05] way that we can succeed.
[00:43:06] >> The way you describe going on vacation
[00:43:08] and feeling very different, it feels
[00:43:09] like when you don't see your kid for a
[00:43:11] few days and they're just like
[00:43:12] completely different. You're like, "How
[00:43:13] did you grow so fast in 3 days?"
[00:43:15] >> Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Let me try to
[00:43:18] summarize the growth levers that you're
[00:43:20] finding is are working. And I'm trying
[00:43:22] to think about this from the perspective
[00:43:23] of uh an AI startup trying to think
[00:43:25] about, hey shoot, how do we grow faster?
[00:43:27] What is lovable figured out? So feels
[00:43:30] like number one is just uh build
[00:43:32] something lovable, something that blows
[00:43:33] people's socks off, but also in a market
[00:43:36] that is growing that people want to pay
[00:43:38] money for like you can build something
[00:43:39] lovable that nobody actually cares about
[00:43:41] that there isn't much money going to the
[00:43:43] space. There's no tide pushing it
[00:43:45] forward and it won't work. I call it
[00:43:47] minimum lovable product. Like it
[00:43:48] shouldn't be minimum viable product
[00:43:50] anymore. Viability is left in back in
[00:43:54] 2020 2010s. Now it's minimum lovable
[00:43:57] product. That's the only thing that
[00:43:58] matters.
[00:43:59] >> I love how these AI tools are letting us
[00:44:01] you know like PMS have always had these
[00:44:03] um what are they uh smoke door test or
[00:44:06] like what's the term just like or is
[00:44:08] that not a real product? Uh
[00:44:09] >> painted door.
[00:44:10] >> Painted door. There it is. Yeah. And and
[00:44:13] it's like okay we just have a landing
[00:44:14] page. There's nothing there. And now AI
[00:44:15] makes it easier to do that and it's like
[00:44:17] more fullfeatured.
[00:44:18] >> Yeah. Well, it's the feedback cycle is
[00:44:20] just completely collapsed. You can go
[00:44:22] from idea to some product uh that is
[00:44:26] functioning to user feedback within a
[00:44:28] day if you want to. I mean depending on
[00:44:30] how fast that you want to run or how
[00:44:31] complex the product is for missions. It
[00:44:34] took us couple of weeks to vip code it
[00:44:36] to the point to where because we also um
[00:44:38] I have a full-time vip coder on my team.
[00:44:41] He's amazing. So like he he wanted to
[00:44:43] create videos like he did a bunch of
[00:44:45] designs for it uh too. So we he he took
[00:44:48] him a couple of weeks. We're testing it
[00:44:49] now and then we'll push it in the
[00:44:51] product. But it's a completely different
[00:44:52] development life cycle. Before uh it
[00:44:55] would just take so many more steps uh
[00:44:57] from user research to uh the design
[00:45:00] sprints uh to prioritizing on
[00:45:03] engineering roadmap to build something
[00:45:05] minimal and and viable to actually test
[00:45:08] to little long testing cycles. Now it's
[00:45:10] just like boom, let's go. Uh, it's taken
[00:45:12] us could have taken us a day. We just
[00:45:15] decided to take a couple of weeks to get
[00:45:17] all of the video pieces correct.
[00:45:18] >> I saw you launched this on LinkedIn. I
[00:45:20] to me it looked like a a full product
[00:45:22] launch. Uh, it is interesting to hear.
[00:45:24] This is just a sort of prototype.
[00:45:26] >> Yes.
[00:45:27] >> Prototype.
[00:45:28] >> Minimum level.
[00:45:29] >> Minimum level. Okay. Uh, I got to ask
[00:45:31] you have this. You said you had a
[00:45:32] full-time vibe coder. What the heck is
[00:45:34] this? Is this like an engineer? Is this
[00:45:36] something else? What is a full-time vibe
[00:45:38] coder?
[00:45:38] >> Great question. This is a new job role
[00:45:40] that is actually popping up here and
[00:45:42] there. Uh it's absolutely fascinating to
[00:45:44] watch uh this development because I see
[00:45:46] vibe coding as a skill being added to a
[00:45:49] lot of job descriptions for designers,
[00:45:51] for product managers, uh for marketers,
[00:45:54] which I think is a really interesting
[00:45:55] shift. Finally, Excel can move over like
[00:45:58] we have a new skill to add that is um
[00:46:00] super empowering and and not three years
[00:46:04] old, but uh vibe coder. So uh his name
[00:46:07] is Lazar and he actually was chief of
[00:46:10] staff in his previous role. So he's not
[00:46:11] technical at all. He's self-taught uh in
[00:46:14] technical aspects of it but he was very
[00:46:17] early on in the vibe coding wave. So he
[00:46:20] learned a lot about it. He was um user
[00:46:23] of all of the vibe coding tools lovable
[00:46:25] included. And uh when I was coming into
[00:46:28] the role I'm like I have so many
[00:46:29] projects that I will vibe code myself.
[00:46:31] So I run this uh woman only hackathon
[00:46:34] she builds. I vip coded the first
[00:46:36] version of that site and like and
[00:46:39] submission process for applications and
[00:46:41] then other people came in and started
[00:46:43] building on top of it. But I vip code
[00:46:45] but then like I don't have enough time
[00:46:47] sometimes because I need to run around
[00:46:49] and I want to push out so many different
[00:46:51] initiatives that I want to test in the
[00:46:52] market with our own products. So um we
[00:46:56] connected on social um like can you like
[00:46:58] would you join us and he joined us for
[00:47:00] uh part-time uh like you're bringing so
[00:47:02] much value for example we partnered with
[00:47:05] Shopify and he created a bunch of
[00:47:06] Shopify lovable templates uh by coded
[00:47:09] for us and it's been so helpful uh to
[00:47:12] have somebody like that that is just
[00:47:13] like pushing all all of these things out
[00:47:15] and he's an absolute expert so he's
[00:47:17] teaching us all too of what is possible
[00:47:20] with lovable because he's on the cutting
[00:47:21] edge of constantly pushing it to the
[00:47:23] limit. So, I I really enjoy having that
[00:47:27] role, which I've never had before in my
[00:47:29] life and in my team.
[00:47:31] >> I I'm not surprised. I've I've never
[00:47:34] heard of this role before as a real
[00:47:35] full-time job. Do you think this is a
[00:47:37] thing people will start hiring for at
[00:47:38] non vibe coding companies?
[00:47:41] >> So, I vibe code myself. So, like I would
[00:47:43] put that as even as a skill on my on my
[00:47:45] resume now. It took me a while to figure
[00:47:47] out by the way like everybody's like,
[00:47:48] "Oh, you just go and like it and it all
[00:47:50] happens automatically." It takes you a
[00:47:52] couple of iterations, couple of projects
[00:47:54] until like you know, okay, this is this
[00:47:56] is how I need to translate it, how I
[00:47:58] need to think about it. But for me, it's
[00:48:00] when I started scaling of what I want to
[00:48:02] vibe code. That's where his value really
[00:48:04] came in because I'm like, okay, I
[00:48:06] understand what is possible. I know what
[00:48:08] needs to be achieved. And some of these
[00:48:10] apps I want to be almost full-blown
[00:48:12] built uh because they're not going to
[00:48:14] get incorporated into the product
[00:48:15] anytime soon. They don't need to be.
[00:48:17] I'll just link to them from uh from our
[00:48:19] headers, so to speak. and uh he really
[00:48:21] accelerated that velocity for me. So
[00:48:23] once you get into VIP coding and you see
[00:48:26] its value within your organization,
[00:48:28] leaning into somebody like that just
[00:48:30] accelerates your velocity because it is
[00:48:32] like an engineer uh on your team. It's
[00:48:34] just they're not to me he's his part his
[00:48:37] part technical but they can be
[00:48:38] nontechnical if they're really good.
[00:48:40] >> That is fascinating. This episode is
[00:48:42] brought to you by Persona, the verified
[00:48:44] identity platform helping organizations
[00:48:46] onboard users, fight fraud, and build
[00:48:49] trust. We talk a lot on this podcast
[00:48:51] about the amazing advances in AI. But
[00:48:54] this can be a double-edged sword. For
[00:48:56] every wow moment, there are fraudsters
[00:48:58] using the same tech to wreak havoc,
[00:49:00] laundering money, taking over employee
[00:49:02] identities, and impersonating
[00:49:03] businesses. Persona helps combat these
[00:49:06] threats with automated user, business,
[00:49:08] and employee verification. Whether
[00:49:10] you're looking to catch candidate fraud,
[00:49:12] meet age restrictions, or keep your
[00:49:14] platform safe, Persona helps you verify
[00:49:16] users in a way that's tailored to your
[00:49:18] specific needs. Best of all, Persona
[00:49:20] makes it easy to know who you're dealing
[00:49:22] with without adding friction for good
[00:49:23] users. This is why leading platforms
[00:49:26] like Etsy, LinkedIn, Square, and Lyft
[00:49:28] trust Persona to secure their platform.
[00:49:31] Persona is also offering my listeners

[00:49:44] Thanks again to Persona for sponsoring
[00:49:45] this episode. Let me kind of go back to
[00:49:47] summarize just real quick the growth
[00:49:49] lovers. I want to move in a somewhat
[00:49:50] different direction. So things that help
[00:49:52] Lovable grow. One is just build
[00:49:54] something in mind that blows your socks
[00:49:55] off as you said. Uh I love these phrases
[00:49:57] out here. The second is uh make noise in
[00:50:00] the market. And the way that Lovable
[00:50:03] does this SEO is tweeting constantly.
[00:50:05] You build something that blows people's
[00:50:07] socks off so that they share things on
[00:50:10] socials themselves. Plus, this
[00:50:11] influencer marketing component and just
[00:50:14] this idea of building in public has been
[00:50:16] really helpful. This point about
[00:50:18] activation being kind of uh embedded
[00:50:20] within the product team of the AI exper
[00:50:22] of the AI agent essentially. So, it's
[00:50:24] essentially not the growth team thinking
[00:50:26] about activation. It's the product team
[00:50:27] that is building the AI magic that is
[00:50:30] obsessed with activation and it feels
[00:50:32] like those are the main the main growth
[00:50:34] levers. Is there anything else that I
[00:50:37] missed?
[00:50:38] >> Community. I think community is really
[00:50:40] important here because you need to bring
[00:50:42] people together as they're exploring
[00:50:44] these capabilities and as they're seeing
[00:50:46] what's possible so they can bounce off
[00:50:48] each other and they can help each other
[00:50:49] out. So I would say community also
[00:50:52] amplifies that word of mouth. It
[00:50:53] amplifies all of the social posting. It
[00:50:55] it amplifies retention mechanisms uh for
[00:50:58] you as well. But community has been a
[00:51:00] huge part of lovable success as well and
[00:51:03] that's something that was started very
[00:51:04] early on. It runs on discord so it's
[00:51:07] nothing fancy. It's not like we build
[00:51:08] anything completely from scratch for
[00:51:10] ourselves. Um and it has hundreds of
[00:51:12] thousands of members and it's um it's
[00:51:15] very lively. We have community managers
[00:51:18] that are making sure that all of the
[00:51:21] questions get answered and the right
[00:51:22] groups are being created. We have
[00:51:23] incredible ambassador pro program now as
[00:51:26] well of people uh doing it. So I would
[00:51:29] say community here again of really
[00:51:32] making software more human is very
[00:51:35] important role. Now now obviously not
[00:51:38] everybody can build a community but
[00:51:39] maybe at least plugging in into
[00:51:40] somebody's community is uh quite
[00:51:42] important as well. And then there's
[00:51:44] another one unless you have a question
[00:51:46] on community.
[00:51:46] >> No keep going. Another one is uh giving
[00:51:49] your product away a lot. And for AI
[00:51:53] products, it may feel counterintuitive
[00:51:56] because they're so costly. Every single
[00:51:58] interaction with an AI product cost
[00:52:00] companies something. There's an LLM pass
[00:52:03] through cost uh that is coming through.
[00:52:06] And uh a lot of especially traditional
[00:52:08] tech companies I see are gating AI
[00:52:10] immediately behind a pay wall because uh
[00:52:13] they're sitting on a really cush um high
[00:52:16] margin profile. And the moment that you
[00:52:18] start giving AI away for free, you're
[00:52:20] like cutting into those uh margins with
[00:52:23] like a like a knife through the butter.
[00:52:26] Now, at the same time, AI being so new
[00:52:29] and the capabilities being so new, you
[00:52:31] have to remove the barrier of entry. You
[00:52:34] have to give a lot of your product away
[00:52:35] for free. But by the way, I don't just
[00:52:37] mean premium. Premium to me is just like
[00:52:40] a baseline. If you're in the new
[00:52:42] category, you need to let people explore
[00:52:44] what it is for free and get that initial
[00:52:47] wow moment. It's not a ha moment, by the
[00:52:49] way. It doesn't need to be aha moment
[00:52:51] anymore. It just needs to be a wow
[00:52:52] moment. And for lovable is that first
[00:52:54] preview generation after your first
[00:52:56] prompt, even though it's absolutely not
[00:52:59] going to be complete thing of what you
[00:53:00] want to build, but you just go this is
[00:53:03] possible like I had no idea I want to
[00:53:05] keep building. And it becomes an
[00:53:06] addictive exercise. But we also give so
[00:53:09] many of our lovable credits away to
[00:53:12] every event to every hackathon. If you
[00:53:14] want to host a lovable hackathon, we
[00:53:16] will sponsor it and give all of the
[00:53:18] participants credits away for free. So
[00:53:19] we give them away as candy and we uh
[00:53:22] basically track them over our LLM cost
[00:53:24] on premium and giveaways as our
[00:53:26] marketing costs and it doesn't go into
[00:53:29] our uh something we need to reduce uh to
[00:53:33] make our margins better. It goes into
[00:53:35] this is something that we need to spend
[00:53:37] more in because this is part of our
[00:53:39] growth secret sauce.
[00:53:41] >> Okay, I want to hear more about the
[00:53:42] growth secret sauce. That is extremely
[00:53:44] interesting. Uh I haven't heard of that
[00:53:45] as a strategy and I can see why this
[00:53:48] makes sense. If the strategy is blow
[00:53:50] people's socks off so they could tell
[00:53:51] their friends, post on all the socials.
[00:53:53] The trick is get more people to try it.
[00:53:55] And so this is and and it's such a new
[00:53:58] crazy thing. Like why would I pay money?
[00:53:59] Why would I even go take the effort to
[00:54:01] like try sign up for an account if I
[00:54:03] don't know what this is? because I don't
[00:54:04] know what I'm doing with it. So, I could
[00:54:05] see how this loop goes faster and faster
[00:54:08] by giving it away.
[00:54:10] >> Exactly. And again, this is very
[00:54:12] uncomfortable sometimes for companies
[00:54:14] that a either used to really AI
[00:54:16] companies have lower profile of margins.
[00:54:19] That's absolutely true. We to find an AI
[00:54:22] company with 80 90% margin profile is
[00:54:24] absolutely impossible. Let's be real.
[00:54:26] We're all sitting somewhere in the 40%
[00:54:29] uh or so, which is a lot smaller. So any
[00:54:32] time that you look at those AI costs as
[00:54:35] your cost center, that's when you're in
[00:54:37] trouble. You fundamentally have to flip
[00:54:39] the script and say, "I need to expose to
[00:54:42] people of what is possible and I need to
[00:54:44] remove the monetization friction out of
[00:54:46] it." Because if you don't, nobody's ever
[00:54:48] going to try it or you're going to be
[00:54:50] very easily overtaken by a competitor
[00:54:52] that will give it away. And let's face
[00:54:53] it, once you hook people, they're more
[00:54:55] likely going to stay with you. So you
[00:54:56] obviously have to still work on the
[00:54:58] retention strategy there. But if you can
[00:55:00] have like for our case if somebody one
[00:55:02] of our users stands up and say hey I'm
[00:55:04] gonna have a hackathon at my work
[00:55:07] unlovable
[00:55:09] can you give us all some free credits to
[00:55:12] play with why would we prevent a person
[00:55:15] who wants to do all of the marketing and
[00:55:17] activating job for us in their company
[00:55:20] from using us? Of course we're like take
[00:55:23] it. How much do you need? How much would
[00:55:25] you like? We will sponsor it all. We
[00:55:27] will give you anything that you need.
[00:55:28] So, we're really leaning into people
[00:55:30] that are wanting to show this magic to
[00:55:32] those around you and empowering them as
[00:55:34] much as possible. And um that is
[00:55:36] something that is actually applies to
[00:55:38] every single product. And I agree, this
[00:55:40] is not a growth strategy that I've ever
[00:55:41] applied in my life on like giving
[00:55:44] product away as much as possible, but it
[00:55:46] is something that uh is more and more
[00:55:48] becoming something that I see that is
[00:55:50] absolutely non-negotiable.
[00:55:52] >> What I'm feeling is like the more
[00:55:54] mind-blowing it is, the more you should
[00:55:55] give it away for free.
[00:55:56] >> Yeah. especially in a competitive market
[00:55:58] where everyone is you know it's hard
[00:56:00] there's like so many companies trying to
[00:56:02] do this thing and so um so it's almost
[00:56:04] like the better you are the more you
[00:56:06] should give it away
[00:56:07] >> right right
[00:56:08] >> and this also explains why uh so much VC
[00:56:10] money has to be raised for these sorts
[00:56:11] of companies because this is not cheap
[00:56:13] like you said you're paying all these
[00:56:14] foundational models a lot of money
[00:56:16] >> yes and no uh because I'm only going to
[00:56:19] say no is because so take a look at
[00:56:21] lovable we're two over 200 million in AR
[00:56:24] at this point we're 100 people charge.
[00:56:26] So our headcom count costs are
[00:56:28] >> very Let me just let me just make sure
[00:56:30] people hear that. 200 millionaire I
[00:56:33] didn't realize 100 people work at
[00:56:35] Lovable.
[00:56:36] >> Yes. And 6 months ago we had 30 people
[00:56:38] working at Lovable. So we triple. So for
[00:56:40] us it's a really big deal. We tripled
[00:56:42] our company size. Uh we're going to
[00:56:43] quadruple it by the end of Yeah. I know
[00:56:46] >> we're big boy and girls now. But for for
[00:56:49] perspective of the headcount cost, it's
[00:56:51] minimal. So we have very little in that
[00:56:54] going on. We are not spending a lot on
[00:56:56] paid marketing. So, we're not a big paid
[00:56:59] marketing driver. Yeah, we're spending
[00:57:00] on influencer marketing, but it's not
[00:57:02] majority of our growth. It's uh low
[00:57:04] double digits uh to to be fair because
[00:57:06] it's it's not why we're successful. It's
[00:57:09] amplifying our success and it's helping
[00:57:11] us reach new audiences. Uh we don't have
[00:57:13] really large sales team. We have only a
[00:57:15] couple sales folks um and they're just
[00:57:17] starting to ramp up their enterprise
[00:57:18] efforts. So, we don't have like really
[00:57:21] big enterprise demand gen costs as well.
[00:57:23] So from that perspective, if you like
[00:57:26] look at the equation and you say, well,
[00:57:28] okay, if you're not going to do a lot of
[00:57:29] paid marketing, if you're not going to
[00:57:31] do a lot of sales because we're really
[00:57:33] only working on hand raisers of people
[00:57:35] that are saying right now that they want
[00:57:36] to buy lovable, then where is like you
[00:57:39] don't have big costs. So you can spend
[00:57:41] it on product and that is the beautiful
[00:57:43] part because you're not when we're
[00:57:45] giving our product away to our
[00:57:46] customers, we're not competing with
[00:57:48] other companies in that space because
[00:57:51] they're just going to use lovable in
[00:57:53] their hackathon on their own and we're
[00:57:55] not competing on AdWords or like in paid
[00:57:58] Google where everybody's buying real
[00:58:01] estate for eyeballs. So from that
[00:58:03] perspective is I think about it more as
[00:58:05] a shift of where we spend and cost and
[00:58:08] honestly it's more efficient way to do
[00:58:11] paid marketing almost in a sense uh
[00:58:14] because of the cost per eyeball that we
[00:58:16] get there is quite a bit lower compared
[00:58:18] to if we were trying to compete it on
[00:58:20] Google. So yes and no to your statement
[00:58:24] because it actually does not deteriorate
[00:58:26] margin profile. We're just shifting of
[00:58:29] where we're spending it. That is an
[00:58:31] incredibly important point you're making
[00:58:32] there. So it's not like uh you're
[00:58:34] generating an incredible amount of
[00:58:36] revenue. Uh so there is money available
[00:58:39] to spend and what you're saying is
[00:58:41] because it's been spreading through word
[00:58:43] of mouth mostly. You're not spending
[00:58:45] tons of money on salespeople. You're not
[00:58:47] spending tons of money on paid ads.
[00:58:49] >> This is just uh an amazing way to get
[00:58:51] more people to use it. So it's kind of
[00:58:53] like a marketing cost.
[00:58:54] >> This is productled growth.
[00:58:56] >> Yeah.
[00:58:57] >> To the max. Supercharged. Yes. because
[00:59:00] you're literally using your product to
[00:59:03] drive that awareness by giving it away
[00:59:05] to the agents in your ecosystem that
[00:59:09] will do that distribution for you.
[00:59:11] >> So fascinating. What a what a wild world
[00:59:14] we're living in. Free stuff for
[00:59:15] everyone.
[00:59:16] >> Yes. Yes. I mean, it's great for
[00:59:18] consumers. This is a great time to be a
[00:59:20] consumer. You have so many options. Like
[00:59:22] everybody's throwing themselves at you,
[00:59:24] giving your product away for free. So,
[00:59:26] it's great to be in the market right
[00:59:28] now. I think it's the the power should
[00:59:30] be with consumer always but with
[00:59:32] software power has not been with
[00:59:34] consumer previously because we were
[00:59:36] forced to use towards some solutions
[00:59:38] because of either how they were chosen
[00:59:40] for us or what was available in the
[00:59:41] market and now that supply is almost
[00:59:43] infinite the demand of from the
[00:59:46] consumers can be very picky and the one
[00:59:49] that serves the best will win
[00:59:52] >> and I think again it's important to
[00:59:53] highlight this is not some kind of VC
[00:59:54] subsidized bubbleish sort of thing like
[00:59:56] there is a lot of money being generated
[00:59:58] that you are spending to help it grow
[01:00:00] faster. It's not like some kind of we're
[01:00:02] just raising more money to give away
[01:00:03] more money. Like you're actually making
[01:00:05] real money. It's not driving it's not
[01:00:06] driven by VC money.
[01:00:07] >> I I I can't comment on specific margin
[01:00:11] details for us. Uh but at the same time,
[01:00:14] the money that we're raising on VC is
[01:00:16] for future development and hardening our
[01:00:18] business.
[01:00:19] >> Uh not because we will not be able to
[01:00:21] survive without it.
[01:00:22] >> Awesome. Okay, great segue too. I want
[01:00:23] to talk about product market fit and
[01:00:25] competition. you had this really
[01:00:26] interesting post that I don't think
[01:00:27] people uh grasp yet, which is that
[01:00:31] product market fit is no longer this
[01:00:33] like we've done it product market fit
[01:00:35] and we're up and to the right now we
[01:00:37] just grow grow now we hire sales people
[01:00:39] it's going to be great uh you've written
[01:00:40] that just product market fit is no
[01:00:42] longer this like you've done it and
[01:00:43] you're good it's this endless fight to
[01:00:46] keep it talk about what you're seeing
[01:00:48] there
[01:00:48] >> so I'll first start with what I've felt
[01:00:51] at least before when people were talking
[01:00:54] about product market fit
[01:00:55] that yeah obviously always product
[01:00:57] market fit is an evolving thing but the
[01:00:59] rate of that evolution was measured in
[01:01:01] years and what is it that you need the
[01:01:03] next product market fit step function
[01:01:05] change which often was called second
[01:01:07] horizon or third horizon sometimes five
[01:01:10] 10 years sometimes even longer that you
[01:01:12] need that you depending on how good your
[01:01:14] and hardy your initial product market
[01:01:16] fit was but you'd spend years scaling
[01:01:18] the original product market fit it was
[01:01:20] like blitz growth stage marketing sales
[01:01:23] growth was very important um that you
[01:01:25] just try to get it to as many people as
[01:01:27] possible and then once you have
[01:01:28] saturation or the cost to getting to the
[01:01:30] marginal people becomes too high, you
[01:01:32] start thinking, okay, what else can I
[01:01:33] offer to help me reach additional people
[01:01:36] or sell more to existing users that I
[01:01:38] already have? And again, the main point
[01:01:40] here is it would take years to get to
[01:01:43] that stage where it became a question
[01:01:45] that you had to face um really hard face
[01:01:48] to face. Now it's 3 months and all of a
[01:01:52] sudden you have to face that question
[01:01:54] again and it's happening because of two
[01:01:55] things in my opinion. Number one in AI
[01:01:59] technology of what LLM is capable of
[01:02:02] doing changes still very rapidly with
[01:02:05] new model release with each new model
[01:02:07] release. So I think we're going to I
[01:02:10] think we'll stabilize at some point and
[01:02:12] it's going to become more marginal but
[01:02:14] we're not there yet. So every 3 months
[01:02:16] or so, every single AI LLM provider
[01:02:19] creates a step function change on what
[01:02:21] is possible with that LLM. And when you
[01:02:25] have this new possibility in just an
[01:02:27] underlying technology that opens up in
[01:02:29] front of you, then it creates another
[01:02:31] ceiling of what is possible to build on
[01:02:34] top of it. And the tricky piece here is
[01:02:38] that it's not enough to just wait for
[01:02:40] that technology to get better and then
[01:02:42] start building on top. you have to build
[01:02:44] beforehand to like make a bet and then
[01:02:47] it's the LLM to catch up because when
[01:02:49] that model releases you already need to
[01:02:51] have that functionality available. So
[01:02:53] that piece is I've never been in a
[01:02:55] company where the fundamental
[01:02:58] capabilities are still changing so
[01:03:00] rapidly and that's the product part. So
[01:03:02] the product can leap to the new
[01:03:04] expectations but let's not talk about
[01:03:06] the market part as well. Consumer
[01:03:09] expectations have never changed this
[01:03:11] fast before. what we expected Chad GPT
[01:03:15] to be able to do and answer and how we
[01:03:17] wanted it to talk to us eight months ago
[01:03:20] versus now is night and day and like the
[01:03:23] deep thinking mode and uh the like the
[01:03:25] how how how deeply it can go into
[01:03:28] answering questions and what is capable
[01:03:29] of being building on top of it. So
[01:03:31] consumer perception has never changed
[01:03:33] this fast too is this unprecedented time
[01:03:36] of consumers all of a sudden like in a
[01:03:38] month saying oh it's not doing this yet
[01:03:42] like I'm bouncing before again consumer
[01:03:44] perceptions would be years to take it's
[01:03:46] actually technology would sometimes be
[01:03:48] able to already address it but consumer
[01:03:50] perception has not not been changed yet
[01:03:52] so it would take a long time so we're
[01:03:54] like in this really weird part where
[01:03:56] both product and market is shifting so
[01:03:57] rapidly that every 3 months I feel like
[01:04:00] we have to recapture our product market
[01:04:03] fit and not just recapture on the same
[01:04:06] technology and with same customers. It's
[01:04:08] both of those pieces of the equation
[01:04:10] change every 3 months. And it's
[01:04:13] terrifying in a way. It's also very
[01:04:15] confusing in a way because we're $200
[01:04:18] million company and we're not solely
[01:04:20] focused on marketing and sales because
[01:04:23] we still have to recapture our product
[01:04:24] market fit. And you know that the team
[01:04:26] that finds your product market fit is
[01:04:28] very different than the team that
[01:04:30] usually scales your company. Yet we have
[01:04:32] to find the team that is capable of
[01:04:34] doing both on ongoing basis. Now I think
[01:04:37] every AI company is in on this product
[01:04:40] market fit treadmill. Uh hopefully that
[01:04:43] treadmill speed slows down. If not I
[01:04:46] think we're going to come up with like
[01:04:47] crazy things of what this LLM and AI
[01:04:49] will be able to do if it's going to
[01:04:50] continue at this cusp. But um it's a
[01:04:53] weird place to be in because every 3
[01:04:56] months we have to throttle on our
[01:04:58] scaling efforts and just reinvent and
[01:05:02] then scale again. But it's like short
[01:05:04] blitz of growth, not these long
[01:05:06] year-long commitments. What makes this
[01:05:08] very real is just this week apparently
[01:05:11] OpenAI had this whole code red moment
[01:05:14] where even though OpenAI by far the
[01:05:17] leading AI assistant over almost a
[01:05:20] billion I think monthly active users
[01:05:22] like basically synonymous with AI around
[01:05:24] the world with Gemini 3 launching their
[01:05:26] market share just started to dip really
[01:05:28] quickly. I think they lost like six
[01:05:30] something% in like a week. And so even
[01:05:34] OpenAI like chat GPT the original the
[01:05:37] one that everyone uses constantly is is
[01:05:39] is in danger.
[01:05:40] >> It's like nobody's nobody's future is
[01:05:43] bulletproof yet. And 10 years ago, if
[01:05:46] you asked me if a $200 million company
[01:05:48] was at risk in losing product market fit
[01:05:50] in the next three months if it's
[01:05:52] experiencing 10% month- over-month
[01:05:54] growth, I would have said, "You're
[01:05:55] crazy." And now that's the reality that
[01:05:58] we live in. And I I I don't know. I it's
[01:06:02] fascinating to world. And what a time to
[01:06:04] be alive.
[01:06:04] >> What a time to be alive. And uh very
[01:06:07] stressful, but the prize at the end is
[01:06:09] massive. That's the, you know, that's
[01:06:10] why this is worth doing. Uh not just,
[01:06:12] you know, monetarily, but just the
[01:06:14] impact it's going to have on the world,
[01:06:15] the way we people build and ship.
[01:06:16] >> Exactly. Exactly. The ceiling of what is
[01:06:19] possible has been raised so massively
[01:06:20] that we haven't even became too closest
[01:06:24] to even see it. I believe so I think
[01:06:27] that that's the exciting part of it.
[01:06:29] >> The way I've seen you write about this
[01:06:30] product market fit challenge is the
[01:06:33] traditional approaches you have these
[01:06:34] like core users that are using it happy
[01:06:36] with it and then you expand to the
[01:06:37] adjacent users and expand to the next
[01:06:39] and you're basically just trying to
[01:06:40] recapture that same core constantly and
[01:06:42] don't even have time to go adjacent.
[01:06:44] Yeah, I Bengali wrote a really wonderful
[01:06:47] article. It was many years ago at this
[01:06:49] point on adjacent user theory and that
[01:06:51] your product market fit expansion when
[01:06:54] you're in no growth stages. The biggest
[01:06:55] opportunity for you to go after is this
[01:06:57] what he called adjacent user which are
[01:06:59] just outside of your core user. They
[01:07:02] have uh somewhat similar needs but maybe
[01:07:04] they're in different geo maybe they have
[01:07:06] slightly different use case, slightly
[01:07:08] different needs. and your biggest way to
[01:07:10] continue growing your product market fit
[01:07:12] without having to go to next horizon is
[01:07:13] to capture those um that next
[01:07:16] group of users. The interesting piece
[01:07:18] here of how I relate to it, we still
[01:07:20] have the core users and by the way those
[01:07:22] core users are mostly pioneers right now
[01:07:24] that are excited by the capabilities.
[01:07:26] Then there's latent majority that is
[01:07:28] filled with adjacent users. And the
[01:07:31] issue right now which I'm actually quite
[01:07:33] worried about us like as a category is
[01:07:35] that we're constantly focusing on
[01:07:37] recapturing the pioneers. We don't have
[01:07:39] time to go after adjacent users and I'm
[01:07:43] worried of whether there's going to be a
[01:07:44] gap in the space where we actually going
[01:07:47] to alienate the latent majority because
[01:07:50] we're so hyperfocused on just staying
[01:07:52] top of mind and t top of capabilities on
[01:07:56] the pioneers. But I don't know the right
[01:07:58] answer here because without the pioneers
[01:08:01] they'll like you need pioneers for a
[01:08:03] latent majority to follow. But if you
[01:08:06] take pioneers and you take them too far
[01:08:09] into capabilities, will latent majority
[01:08:11] never be able to catch up? Uh maybe this
[01:08:14] is a fruitless concern, but it's just
[01:08:16] like something that I think about
[01:08:17] because at this stage we should be
[01:08:19] working on adjacent users and and I
[01:08:22] would argue maybe OpenAI definitely
[01:08:24] started have uh to do that with so many
[01:08:27] people they have on their platform, but
[01:08:29] not most of the other AI companies.
[01:08:31] >> I completely see what you're thinking
[01:08:32] there. Like a brand could just become
[01:08:34] known as that's just for like startups
[01:08:36] and prototyping and it's not for serious
[01:08:37] work.
[01:08:38] >> Yeah. Or it's like it's for just like
[01:08:40] for it's for techies. It's like for tech
[01:08:43] people. It's like it never actually
[01:08:44] enters the people uh outside of our
[01:08:48] little bubble that we live in.
[01:08:50] >> We kind of touched on this a little bit
[01:08:51] of just like working in AI, working on
[01:08:54] AI companies. Uh challenging, stressful,
[01:08:57] a lot of work. What's your advice for
[01:08:59] folks that are thinking about should I
[01:09:01] join a lovable? Should I join a cursor?
[01:09:03] Should I just go work at Google Micros?
[01:09:05] You know, not not to throw them under
[01:09:07] the bus or anything, but just although
[01:09:08] Google very very successful in AI now,
[01:09:10] maybe less AI focused company.
[01:09:13] >> I really believe that there's different
[01:09:15] you need to understand what's the
[01:09:16] environment that is right for you. Just
[01:09:18] please understand that AI companies are
[01:09:21] very hectic at the moment. They're very
[01:09:23] unstable by definition of that product
[01:09:26] market fit treadmill about that
[01:09:28] distribution of how they're actually
[01:09:30] distributed to the market really
[01:09:31] changing about how product is even being
[01:09:33] developed in the first place. So if you
[01:09:35] are very comfortable in being in that
[01:09:37] messy middle and uh really comfortable
[01:09:39] of converting chaos into clarity for you
[01:09:43] and those around you then yeah AI
[01:09:45] company is a wonderful place for you to
[01:09:47] really absorb new skill sets right now
[01:09:50] because I even before joining lovable
[01:09:52] when I kept seeing AI I'm like my gosh
[01:09:55] like I'm so tired of seeing AI
[01:09:57] everywhere. Is it really changing the
[01:09:59] world? Like is it really changing the
[01:10:01] way people work? And when I was um I was
[01:10:03] at Dropbox before and yeah, we would use
[01:10:05] AI here and there and I would use
[01:10:07] CHIGPT. I've never used AI there the way
[01:10:09] I use AI at lovable and the things that
[01:10:12] I'm capable of accomplishing at Lovable
[01:10:14] and I don't know if I've ever would have
[01:10:16] made that leap so fast unless I joined
[01:10:18] Lovable. If I would have just read or
[01:10:20] listened about it, it's just different
[01:10:22] compared to be surrounded by people
[01:10:24] where it's expectation. It's not like a
[01:10:27] nice to have or something that
[01:10:28] somebody's asking you to do. This is
[01:10:30] just how you get things done and you
[01:10:32] have to think about everything of like
[01:10:33] what can AI do here versus where do I
[01:10:36] add value versus like in a traditional
[01:10:39] sense of work is like I start with my
[01:10:41] own value and then I augmented with AI
[01:10:44] and here like the mindset is completely
[01:10:46] uh shifted. Now I don't think AI is
[01:10:48] replacing everybody's job. So like
[01:10:50] please don't like don't look at it as a
[01:10:51] as as that cliche saying. I actually
[01:10:55] often call AI as like average
[01:10:57] intelligence that helps me get the
[01:10:59] platform up and then I add my human
[01:11:01] thinking and my human creativity on top
[01:11:04] of it to get it to the next level. But
[01:11:06] at least I can get this base level done
[01:11:08] with AI really freaking quickly. So from
[01:11:11] that perspective, I think if you want to
[01:11:13] leaprog on what it means to be AI native
[01:11:16] employee and how to use all of these AI
[01:11:18] tools, you should go to AI company. But
[01:11:21] if you know that your superpower is in
[01:11:23] more structure, in more definition, in a
[01:11:26] really high specialty of things, because
[01:11:29] in AI companies, they're all fairly
[01:11:31] small. So, you'll have to generalize
[01:11:32] quite a bit and have a lot of ownership
[01:11:35] of areas that you usually maybe not have
[01:11:37] ownership over, then you shouldn't join
[01:11:39] it because AI companies will evolve to
[01:11:42] be more stable too. So, it's just a
[01:11:44] matter of time on where you can join. So
[01:11:46] I would just urge people to look at
[01:11:47] their superpowers and the type of
[01:11:49] environments that really speak to them
[01:11:51] so they can feel happy because this can
[01:11:55] lead to burnout for wrong type of
[01:11:58] personalities very quickly.
[01:12:00] >> Yeah. My sense is if you want work life
[01:12:02] balance, don't join one of these
[01:12:04] companies because that's just not the
[01:12:05] way they work.
[01:12:06] >> I don't know if I'd go that far. I mean
[01:12:09] I have family. I have two kids. I feel
[01:12:11] like I have a very good work life
[01:12:12] balance. Uh, but I put in boundaries for
[01:12:15] myself. Like I know when I need time
[01:12:17] off, I need because I know when my brain
[01:12:19] starts to overheat, so to speak. Uh, but
[01:12:22] I I also know that work is my hobby and
[01:12:24] it's my passion and I will this is the
[01:12:28] best work of my life that I'm doing
[01:12:29] right now. There's no other place that
[01:12:31] I'd rather be uh than to be here. So, I
[01:12:34] think that you just need to be more
[01:12:36] careful about setting your own
[01:12:38] boundaries that you know you need. But
[01:12:41] um I mean let's face it I don't think
[01:12:42] anybody has work life balance regardless
[01:12:44] of a company that they work at even at
[01:12:46] Google or like Microsoft or any of the
[01:12:50] others. I think everybody is freaking
[01:12:52] out and running as fast as they can.
[01:12:55] It's just they're running it in
[01:12:56] different structures. I'm really glad
[01:12:58] you said that and corrected me there
[01:13:00] that it is possible to work at a company
[01:13:03] one of if not the fastest growing
[01:13:05] company in history and actually uh have
[01:13:07] work life balance to get sleep to spend
[01:13:09] time with your kids and family.
[01:13:11] >> You just have to protect it uh
[01:13:13] ruthlessly but you also need to be
[01:13:15] realistic with how much is expected out
[01:13:18] of you and you need to feel confident
[01:13:20] that you'll be able to deliver it. And
[01:13:22] by the way, you won't be able to deliver
[01:13:24] it unless you use AI in many aspects of
[01:13:27] your work life. So that's like the piece
[01:13:28] that helps you actually get to hit those
[01:13:31] expectations of outcomes that you need
[01:13:33] to do and the velocity. But um I'm I'm
[01:13:36] very protective of my personal time with
[01:13:38] kids. Like why did I have children if
[01:13:40] I'm not going to spend time with them?
[01:13:41] So like those are part of the
[01:13:42] non-negotiables um that I bring along
[01:13:46] with me in every single work. for people
[01:13:48] that maybe have trouble setting
[01:13:49] boundaries or just not good at this
[01:13:51] anything what do you what works for you
[01:13:52] is it just is it as easy as just telling
[01:13:54] people here's where I need to leave what
[01:13:56] do you what's what advice do you have
[01:13:57] for people to set boundaries like that
[01:13:58] >> so first of all I would not think about
[01:14:00] it as a work life balance there's no
[01:14:02] such thing as balance or balance feels
[01:14:03] like oh I have enough time for
[01:14:05] everything I don't have enough time for
[01:14:06] anything but I prioritize my family in
[01:14:10] some moments I prioritize work in other
[01:14:13] moments and I don't try to balance the
[01:14:15] two I go where I'm needed and where I go
[01:14:17] and I feel like I'm not going to regret
[01:14:19] the choices that I'm making today. So,
[01:14:21] I'm constantly trying to put myself in
[01:14:23] the future and say, well, I resent
[01:14:24] myself if I make this choice right now.
[01:14:26] And if the answer is yes, I don't make
[01:14:28] that choice. And sometimes I have to say
[01:14:30] no to Anton and say like I can't make it
[01:14:33] or I won't be there. I need to be here
[01:14:35] with my family or like today I need to
[01:14:37] cancel my day. My kid is sick and he
[01:14:39] needs me and I need to be I need to take
[01:14:42] him to the doctor. So I think that just
[01:14:44] making in the moment more like in every
[01:14:47] day even sometimes in the hour decisions
[01:14:49] to me works better than trying to
[01:14:51] balance something that is completely
[01:14:53] unachievable and it feels overwhelming
[01:14:55] to even think about. But I prioritize
[01:14:57] this in my sleep, uh my health, my
[01:15:00] workout schedule, my kids, my family, my
[01:15:02] husband, um and just my downtime because
[01:15:05] I know that I'm most creative once I
[01:15:07] have separation from work because then I
[01:15:09] come in with like all still firing and I
[01:15:12] have so many more ideas about it. So to
[01:15:14] me, it's actually part of doing my best
[01:15:16] work is to take time off.
[01:15:18] >> That is really great advice. I want to
[01:15:20] touch on what it's like to work at
[01:15:22] Lovable because it feels like Lovable is
[01:15:25] at the cutting edge of what working at
[01:15:28] in product is going to be. So, you
[01:15:30] mentioned a little bit about how you're
[01:15:31] always talking to AI asking questions.
[01:15:33] Is there any any other kind of anecdotes
[01:15:34] of just how people operate at Lovable
[01:15:37] that is really unique or weird or funny
[01:15:39] or interesting that might be helpful for
[01:15:41] people to try in their company?
[01:15:43] >> Yeah, I mean we use Lovable at Lovable a
[01:15:46] lot. Like all of our internal tools are
[01:15:47] built on Lovables. Uh we actually have
[01:15:49] our first hackathon on lovable happening
[01:15:51] next week. Uh where we're going to
[01:15:53] entire company is just going to take
[01:15:55] full day to pipe code um and see what we
[01:15:58] actually have happen. We prototype
[01:16:00] everything on lovable. So our specs yeah
[01:16:03] we do still have a written spec but it
[01:16:05] always accompanied by a lovable
[01:16:06] prototype uh that everybody can interact
[01:16:09] with and uh to click around with and
[01:16:11] provide feedback and everybody punches
[01:16:13] in and also like does some edits if they
[01:16:15] have any better ideas. So I uh create
[01:16:18] mocks on lovable. So for example, we
[01:16:21] need to make some pricing changes um a
[01:16:23] pricing page changes. I take a
[01:16:25] screenshot of our pricing page. I go to
[01:16:27] lovable. I say recreate this pricing
[01:16:28] page, make these changes and then I send
[01:16:31] that to my engineering team saying hey
[01:16:32] this is what I want to happen and then
[01:16:34] like they take it from there. So we just
[01:16:37] you and Chad GPT I use a lot for
[01:16:39] brainstorming especially the deep
[01:16:41] thinking mode. I love it. It takes a
[01:16:43] long time but it's so worth it. Uh
[01:16:45] sometimes it has crazy ideas, sometimes
[01:16:48] it does. Like sometimes I was like,
[01:16:49] "Yeah, this is like nothing new to me."
[01:16:51] So it's not interesting, but like it
[01:16:53] gets me thinking and it gets me look at
[01:16:55] the different angles and um lots of um I
[01:16:58] use Granola a lot for example because to
[01:17:00] me it's super helpful to get AI
[01:17:03] summaries of the meetings and it's very
[01:17:05] powerful for me. I use Whisper Flow a
[01:17:07] lot because I feel like I have no time
[01:17:09] to type anymore. So I just like talk to
[01:17:11] my phone and talk to my laptop all the
[01:17:13] time uh in order to do it. But we're
[01:17:15] even thinking about all of the customer
[01:17:18] support automations uh that are done
[01:17:20] through AI. How do we um every single
[01:17:23] aspect of what we do is question is
[01:17:26] asked what can AI do here first and then
[01:17:30] how we can add ourselves into the
[01:17:32] equation. But lovable for us uh having
[01:17:35] unlimited credits at lovable is a pretty
[01:17:38] awesome perk I have to say. Like I
[01:17:40] sometimes have to pinch myself. I'm like
[01:17:42] I get paid to VIP code. This is like so
[01:17:44] fun.
[01:17:45] >> I feel like that engineer or that VIP
[01:17:46] code engineer, he's he's like actually
[01:17:48] >> my dream job. I want his job. I feel
[01:17:50] like I Yeah. I I got into the wrong line
[01:17:53] of profession here.
[01:17:54] >> Oh man. Okay. Uh is there anything else
[01:17:57] about Lovable? Because the what I think
[01:17:58] about actually I interviewed the
[01:17:59] perplexity founders back in the day
[01:18:01] years ago and they shared like before we
[01:18:03] talked to anyone for advice we first
[01:18:05] asked Chacha PT and I was just like that
[01:18:08] is the most insane thing I've ever
[01:18:09] heard. How can you possibly work that
[01:18:11] way and now that's how everyone works
[01:18:13] and so I'm curious just I don't know
[01:18:15] like how I don't know how Anton works.
[01:18:16] Is there anyone else that just like way
[01:18:17] in the future of here's how things might
[01:18:19] be? So for me especially for product and
[01:18:21] growth I and even marketing at some
[01:18:23] point it's in some capacity when I have
[01:18:25] an idea in my head it like it sounds so
[01:18:28] freaking cool and sometimes I can even
[01:18:30] like I put it in paper and it's like a
[01:18:32] this is like like we need to do it and
[01:18:34] then like I go and try to vibe code it
[01:18:36] and I'm like oh like this like I don't
[01:18:38] see the magic anymore like or I can't
[01:18:41] like I can't envision it anymore or
[01:18:43] sometimes I'm like yeah yeah and like
[01:18:45] there's more there's more. So to me it's
[01:18:47] actually has helped really complete the
[01:18:49] ideation process for me quite a bit
[01:18:52] because then I actually try to go and
[01:18:54] build it and it breaks down some of the
[01:18:56] elements of what's important, what's
[01:18:57] not. So it's taking me on product
[01:19:01] development life cycle so much further
[01:19:04] down and then it creates a much better
[01:19:06] communication vehicle with my engineers
[01:19:08] too because like I then can tell them
[01:19:10] exactly what's important, what not. So
[01:19:12] to me it's been great because sometimes
[01:19:14] we envision things that are so much
[01:19:16] better than the reality and before until
[01:19:18] it hands it off to design like we would
[01:19:21] never be a like designers would do it
[01:19:22] for us and try to make it awesome versus
[01:19:25] I often stop my ideas in tracks super
[01:19:28] early on without pushing it forward
[01:19:31] versus other times I might have pushed
[01:19:32] it too for too far too long even through
[01:19:36] design queue or even like pitching to
[01:19:38] leadership and uh I find that very
[01:19:41] powerful because It calibrates me really
[01:19:43] quickly.
[01:19:44] >> Awesome. Okay, last question. I want to
[01:19:46] talk about something that you've written
[01:19:47] about that is a really uh I think it's a
[01:19:49] really important topic, something that
[01:19:50] we should surface is you wrote this post
[01:19:52] called I'm worried about women in tech.
[01:19:54] Talk about what you're seeing here. What
[01:19:56] you're noticing, what you think might be
[01:19:58] going in the wrong direction.
[01:20:00] >> Yeah. There's actually conflicting data
[01:20:01] points about how um women, you're
[01:20:04] talking about women, right? Women. Yeah.
[01:20:07] uh there's conflicting data points about
[01:20:09] uh how women are keeping up with AI
[01:20:12] technology and wave because there's a
[01:20:14] bunch of reports that has been done that
[01:20:16] show massive gap between women adopting
[01:20:19] AI versus men adopting AI which points
[01:20:22] the story that um men are just like
[01:20:24] widening the gap uh of like
[01:20:27] accessibility for technology and whoever
[01:20:29] is adopting AI right now is getting paid
[01:20:31] the most gets the most opportunities I
[01:20:33] mean we're seeing like in say in aqua
[01:20:35] hires right now where people are getting
[01:20:37] paid more for their talent than for the
[01:20:39] companies that they've created and
[01:20:41] that's like a really interesting trend
[01:20:43] that is occurring and a lot of it is
[01:20:44] fueled on um on this wave of AI and
[01:20:47] women are not really present there like
[01:20:49] if you can think about like $1 million
[01:20:52] aqua hire that has been in the news that
[01:20:54] is a woman like I can't think of one if
[01:20:56] you look at AI companies and their CEOs
[01:20:59] uh most of it is men if you if you look
[01:21:01] at the company's composition of um in AI
[01:21:05] companies it's mostly men. To me, this
[01:21:07] really came to the head of when I came
[01:21:10] to Lovable and I'm like, it's pink, it's
[01:21:12] purple brand, it's a heart, it's
[01:21:14] lovable. I'm like, I'm sure this is
[01:21:16] where it's 50/50 men versus women. And
[01:21:20] uh although we don't collect this
[01:21:22] information, but just like through third
[01:21:24] party um uh autofill, we saw it's like
[01:21:28] 20% at most. And I'm like, what is
[01:21:30] happening? Not again. Why is this again
[01:21:32] not being adopted by women? And uh
[01:21:35] obviously I don't know all of the
[01:21:37] answers. Um I think that this is early
[01:21:40] on that we can shortcut it. And by the
[01:21:42] way, I also don't want to put this as a
[01:21:45] indication that men are to blame because
[01:21:47] I think men are doing wonderful job
[01:21:50] really spearheading the horizons and
[01:21:52] showing us what's possible and like
[01:21:53] leading the charge. I'm just afraid that
[01:21:56] so many women are stuck in that latent
[01:21:58] majority that is just not catching up.
[01:22:00] And my worry is that it's going to
[01:22:02] affect the hirable talent. is going to
[01:22:05] step us back again in the composition of
[01:22:07] the workplace of the diversity and maybe
[01:22:09] it matters maybe it doesn't like
[01:22:11] whichever side that you s sit on but I
[01:22:13] think that there is it's if needs to be
[01:22:16] built for everybody in the world and for
[01:22:18] that it needs to be built by a
[01:22:19] representative sample of uh people that
[01:22:22] are behind the product as well. So I I I
[01:22:27] just find it fascinating that even when
[01:22:29] the barrier to building has been lowered
[01:22:32] uh versus like you don't need computer
[01:22:34] science degree which I appreciate
[01:22:36] there's not that many women that are
[01:22:38] getting we're still seeing the gaping um
[01:22:42] gap on the adoption between genders
[01:22:46] which is just is I I I I don't know
[01:22:48] there's like something very frustrating
[01:22:49] about that.
[01:22:50] >> Yeah. Uh the thing that struck with me
[01:22:51] with from your post is there has been a
[01:22:54] lot of progress being made in the last
[01:22:56] decade and now AI is just kind of
[01:22:58] turning it all back, turning it all
[01:22:59] around. Hopefully not. I think that
[01:23:02] we're early on enough that we can bridge
[01:23:04] the gap. I think sometimes uh women just
[01:23:08] need space and ability to discover it.
[01:23:10] Uh and uh that's what we're doing at
[01:23:12] lovable. We have this initiative uh she
[01:23:15] builds where we have collect we have
[01:23:17] create a hackathon for women only and we
[01:23:20] give them unlimited access to lovable
[01:23:21] for 48 hours and um they come together
[01:23:24] as a community and they build together
[01:23:25] and there's like beautiful things that
[01:23:27] start to come out of it which I've never
[01:23:28] anticipated before but so many women in
[01:23:31] that hackathon for us build help for
[01:23:34] their with their elderly parents or with
[01:23:36] their kids or with the household or for
[01:23:39] their church group or for the the kids
[01:23:42] basketball team. solutions should have
[01:23:44] hyper local, hyper relevant, very needed
[01:23:47] for what they need in their life and
[01:23:49] something that was never been able to
[01:23:50] build before because of how expensive
[01:23:53] software was because it would never
[01:23:55] going to become potentially a hundred
[01:23:57] million dollar companies but it also
[01:23:59] doesn't need to be anymore. So I just
[01:24:01] want to bring women to build more and
[01:24:04] vibe code more so we can have more
[01:24:06] diversity in software that is even
[01:24:08] created because I think that we all have
[01:24:11] a unique take on what problems that we
[01:24:14] can solve and I want everybody's voices
[01:24:16] to be heard.
[01:24:17] >> I'll give the URL for shebuilds. I
[01:24:19] pulled it up while you're talking.
[01:24:20] Shebuilds.lovable.app
[01:24:23] >> bitecoded on lovable minimum viable
[01:24:26] product.
[01:24:27] >> Minimal lovable product.
[01:24:28] >> Minimal lovable product.
[01:24:29] >> There it is. So when is this happening?
[01:24:31] Is this December 15th, 18th? So it's
[01:24:33] >> Yeah, we have it. We're running it
[01:24:35] constantly. So our next cohort uh starts
[01:24:38] um December 15th, but we're going to
[01:24:41] have more. We're planning a massive one
[01:24:42] on International Women's Day.
[01:24:44] >> So that's the one that if you can come
[01:24:47] join us.
[01:24:48] >> Awesome. I don't know if you Okay, so
[01:24:49] some glimmer of hope. I don't know if
[01:24:50] you saw this tweet where I tagged you
[01:24:52] the other day or maybe it was this
[01:24:53] today. I was looking at my most recent
[01:24:56] podcast video performance and the top
[01:24:59] four are all women and they're all AI
[01:25:03] oriented and they're above Stuart
[01:25:04] Butterfields, founder of Slack, above
[01:25:06] Gamma's CEO Grant. So maybe a glimmer of
[01:25:10] hope.
[01:25:10] >> Yeah, absolutely. I think there's lots
[01:25:12] of glimmers of hope. I think we can just
[01:25:13] all lean in and make sure that nobody's
[01:25:16] left behind in this wave. And uh that's
[01:25:19] not to stop people that are marching
[01:25:21] ahead. This is just to open up
[01:25:23] opportunities for everybody around us.
[01:25:25] >> Awesome. And we'll link to that post if
[01:25:26] people want to get a deeper perspective
[01:25:28] what you're saying. Elena, is there
[01:25:30] anything else that you wanted to share?
[01:25:32] Is there anything else you want to
[01:25:34] remind people of before we get to our
[01:25:36] one question lightning round?
[01:25:38] >> I guess the only other thing that I will
[01:25:40] share uh is for AI companies when it
[01:25:43] comes to hiring. It's really interesting
[01:25:46] also the kind of the shift in the type
[01:25:49] of personas that end up being hired that
[01:25:51] I see for me at least it's quite
[01:25:53] different compared to anywhere uh that
[01:25:55] I've worked before and that is uh
[01:25:57] there's this narrative going in the
[01:25:59] market always that like new hire sorry
[01:26:01] new grads have no jobs in the market
[01:26:03] left because all of the entry-level jobs
[01:26:05] are automated. I actually think that's
[01:26:07] quite false because new grads especially
[01:26:10] AI native new grads. So it's very
[01:26:13] important for kids that are entering
[01:26:15] into the work I shouldn't say kids young
[01:26:18] adults that are entering into uh the the
[01:26:21] workforce that they really know AI which
[01:26:24] is there's another like really big issue
[01:26:26] that our schools are not teaching AI uh
[01:26:28] students. So, this is like something
[01:26:30] else that we need to fix as a as a
[01:26:32] category because otherwise we're
[01:26:33] literally setting up our uh young for
[01:26:35] for a complete failure. But I think it's
[01:26:39] incredible to see some of those new
[01:26:41] graduates come in and what they're
[01:26:42] capable of doing. I have um we have
[01:26:46] multiple new graduates at lovable that
[01:26:48] are working and I learned so much from
[01:26:51] them and you need to obviously have the
[01:26:53] right atmosphere where people with
[01:26:55] experience like old guard like me that
[01:26:58] can look at the new guard and take
[01:27:00] really hear them and see them and really
[01:27:02] change the way that I operate based on
[01:27:04] how they do things. So, uh, make sure
[01:27:07] that you bring some of that fresh talent
[01:27:09] that doesn't understand any of the
[01:27:12] baggage that we came from and that can
[01:27:15] really look at the future in technology
[01:27:17] and what can unlock from a completely
[01:27:19] new lens. So, highly recommend putting
[01:27:22] those into your team as like little
[01:27:25] fireballs that are going to be sometimes
[01:27:27] hard to contain, but can start the best
[01:27:30] the best initiatives for you forward.
[01:27:32] And then um it's also interesting that
[01:27:34] there's a really high demand for uh
[01:27:36] ex-founders now for like those people
[01:27:38] that are truly have a lot of agency and
[01:27:41] um high autonomy. So instead of just
[01:27:43] having people that have been working in
[01:27:45] the corporate world, the failed startup
[01:27:47] founders are now hot demand for a lot of
[01:27:50] these AI companies. So like these
[01:27:52] personas that we traditionally would not
[01:27:54] prioritize in companies uh to to hire
[01:27:58] are now becoming the hottest commodity
[01:28:00] and the highest going talent which is I
[01:28:02] think is fascinating and it's like the
[01:28:03] wonderful thing that is changing the how
[01:28:07] uh the culture inside operates
[01:28:08] >> that is really interesting and really
[01:28:10] empowering just this idea that uh if you
[01:28:12] need gradu's hope you're not you're not
[01:28:14] going to be out of job.
[01:28:14] >> Absolutely. Absolutely.
[01:28:15] >> You might have an advantage. Yeah.
[01:28:17] >> You you do have a you have to lead with
[01:28:18] that. That's the thing like you have to
[01:28:20] lead with the things that you can you
[01:28:22] are capable of achieving knowing that
[01:28:24] what you have with AI because that is a
[01:28:26] lot of people especially in traditional
[01:28:28] tech or in more traditional companies
[01:28:30] they're looking for somebody to show
[01:28:31] them because it's really hard to figure
[01:28:33] it out on your own uh versus coming in
[01:28:35] and seeing and then copying.
[01:28:37] >> Well Elena with that we reached our very
[01:28:39] exciting lightning round because it's
[01:28:40] your fourth time I'm not going to ask
[01:28:41] you all the questions I always ask you
[01:28:43] so I'm just going to ask you one
[01:28:44] question. So Lovable is based in
[01:28:46] Stockholm Sweden. I'm curious just like
[01:28:48] what do you what's something you love
[01:28:49] about Stockholm that you weren't
[01:28:51] expecting? Is there like a food, a
[01:28:53] restaurant, I don't know, something?
[01:28:55] >> Well, you always have to say Swedish
[01:28:57] meatballs. I mean, I've never liked
[01:28:59] meatballs before. Uh so like and now
[01:29:02] it's it's so good here. It's so good. So
[01:29:05] like every time one of my meals here
[01:29:08] throughout the day involves it. But I
[01:29:10] actually really love the sounds. They're
[01:29:12] like they're I don't know. They're so
[01:29:15] they just taste different. It's not like
[01:29:16] the IKEA. It's not like the IKEA Swedish
[01:29:18] meatballs.
[01:29:19] >> Well, I have been to IKEA here because
[01:29:22] that is a Swedish company, too. It like
[01:29:23] reminded me of uh in person Amazon. It
[01:29:25] was like absolutely incredible. IKEA
[01:29:27] here is like next level. But, uh food
[01:29:30] food I Swedish meatballs for sure.
[01:29:32] Honestly, how clean the city is like
[01:29:34] it's it's kind of incredible. The
[01:29:36] architecture like everything is so built
[01:29:38] out. It's like picture perfect. Like
[01:29:40] it's on the card. I don't know. It's
[01:29:41] It's
[01:29:44] different compared to like most of the
[01:29:45] large cities that I've been at that are
[01:29:47] a little bit more worn down.
[01:29:49] >> So fun. Makes me want to visit get some
[01:29:51] meatballs.
[01:29:53] >> Yeah. You're in the visit during the
[01:29:54] summer. Otherwise, the daylight here is
[01:29:56] really is really tight during the
[01:29:58] winter.
[01:29:59] >> Okay, good tip. Okay. Uh two final
[01:30:01] questions. Where can folks find you
[01:30:02] online if they want to reach out, maybe
[01:30:04] learn more? And how can listeners be
[01:30:05] useful to you?
[01:30:06] >> Yes, please find me online uh on
[01:30:08] LinkedIn. Uh please feel free to follow
[01:30:10] me. Always engage on my post if you want
[01:30:12] to engage with me because that's um the
[01:30:14] place that I always talk to people. I
[01:30:16] have my newsletter as well um that um
[01:30:20] baby baby steps compared to what Lenny
[01:30:22] has, but it's elenena verna.com. I also
[01:30:24] try to that's where I post most of my
[01:30:26] findings that that I experience at my
[01:30:28] work. So if you want to continue seeing
[01:30:30] how my thinking evolves or what the
[01:30:32] patterns that I noticed, that's where to
[01:30:34] find me. and how to be useful to me. Um,
[01:30:37] really pressure test my thinking because
[01:30:39] so many things are changing right now.
[01:30:41] I'm honestly not even sure myself of
[01:30:43] what is a pattern versus what is just a
[01:30:45] data point. So, I'd love to just engage
[01:30:47] in as many conversations as possible uh
[01:30:50] and hear your opinions because that will
[01:30:52] help us as an industry just understand
[01:30:55] what is actually happening and makes
[01:30:57] more sense out of this whole thing.
