[00:00:00] Goldman Sachs has been around for 155
[00:00:01] years and there's been a lot said about
[00:00:03] Goldman Sachs's culture and Goldman
[00:00:05] Sachs's culture is unique. But I would
[00:00:06] also say it's constantly changing
[00:00:09] >> and you better be working at defining
[00:00:12] what you want it to be and constantly
[00:00:14] reshaping it and amplifying what you
[00:00:16] think really matters. The general ethos
[00:00:18] of the firm is if you build trust with
[00:00:21] clients, if you take a long-term view,
[00:00:23] if you do the right thing, good things
[00:00:25] will happen. And I I've watched that in
[00:00:27] my career and I believe it deeply.
[00:00:46] Okay, this is a special episode with
[00:00:48] David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs,
[00:00:50] an incredible company, been around 150
[00:00:54] years, just a terrific person in a
[00:00:56] terrific company. We get into a whole
[00:00:58] bunch of topics. One was decision-m and
[00:01:01] in particular, you've got something
[00:01:03] going, it's kind of wobbling. When do
[00:01:06] you double down and when do you pull
[00:01:08] away? and he's he recently has had a
[00:01:10] Whopper decision where they had a
[00:01:12] consumer partnership with Apple and they
[00:01:15] recently basically walked away from that
[00:01:17] partnership and so we get behind the
[00:01:19] scenes on that decision. I think it was
[00:01:20] pretty interesting. He credits culture a
[00:01:22] lot with why they've been around for 150
[00:01:24] years. I've had a ton of CEOs and it's
[00:01:27] really thrived. He's really thrived in
[00:01:29] the job and we get into culture. Culture
[00:01:31] is a big reason why HubSpot's only 19
[00:01:33] years has been successful as well. I
[00:01:36] hope you like the episode. David is very
[00:01:38] sharp. Uh I he joined the company. It
[00:01:41] had a 40 billion market cap I believe
[00:01:44] and now it's something like 160 billion
[00:01:46] less than a decade later. So he's very
[00:01:49] very good and very thoughtful. Hope you
[00:01:51] enjoy it. Thanks for joining us.
[00:01:53] >> Thank you for having me.
[00:01:54] >> Um when I was a CEO, I really admired
[00:01:58] Steve Jobs. Um I tried to emulate him. I
[00:02:03] kind of really studied him and followed
[00:02:04] his playbook and it largely served me
[00:02:07] pretty well. Who's your Steve Jobs?
[00:02:09] >> That's a great question. I, you know,
[00:02:11] I'd start by saying that, you know,
[00:02:13] Steve was obvious obviously
[00:02:14] extraordinary in the context of what he
[00:02:16] did.
[00:02:17] >> Although I don't know that most public
[00:02:21] company CEOs
[00:02:23] could model Steve and get away with it
[00:02:27] in uh in today's in today's world. But
[00:02:30] he was extraordinary in terms of his his
[00:02:32] his his focus, you know, his vision for
[00:02:35] what he thought really mattered. I don't
[00:02:38] I've thought a lot about this because
[00:02:40] I've been asked similar questions, you
[00:02:41] know, over the years. And I I don't have
[00:02:43] a Steve Jobs.
[00:02:45] >> One of the things on your Mount
[00:02:46] Rushmore.
[00:02:47] >> Well, I mean there there that you know,
[00:02:48] I mentioned, you know, some people right
[00:02:50] now that I, you know, I watch and I I I
[00:02:52] think enormously high. I mentioned Satia
[00:02:54] um Nadella and you know one of the
[00:02:57] things I've learned from him in my own
[00:02:59] journey as a CEO is he's an incredibly
[00:03:02] empathetic leader
[00:03:03] >> and you know it's hard you know to move
[00:03:07] an organization and also exhibit empathy
[00:03:11] >> um and um and so I've you know I've
[00:03:14] watched some of what Sati has done you
[00:03:16] know in that context because um you know
[00:03:18] I think I think he leads with an
[00:03:20] enormous amount of empathy besides the
[00:03:21] fact that he's a great strategic thinker
[00:03:22] and a whole bunch of other things.
[00:03:24] >> Um he's done an extraordinary job with
[00:03:26] uh with Microsoft
[00:03:28] >> but then you also you know you can also
[00:03:31] you know pick and choose you know people
[00:03:34] that you know at times have led
[00:03:37] extraordinary transformations.
[00:03:39] you know his his journey is a different
[00:03:42] one at this point for a variety of
[00:03:44] reasons but there was a period of time
[00:03:46] where I was really watching the way Bob
[00:03:47] Iger was transforming Disney and you
[00:03:51] know it was a difficult transformation
[00:03:52] and so
[00:03:54] I've tried to pick out things that are
[00:03:58] going on with different CEOs and
[00:04:00] constantly say what can I learn one of
[00:04:01] the great advantages I have in my job is
[00:04:04] part of my job is to travel around and
[00:04:05] spend time with CEOs
[00:04:06] >> interesting people
[00:04:07] >> so you get with interesting people so
[00:04:08] you get ask them, you know, why you
[00:04:10] doing this? Why'd you do this? How did
[00:04:12] this work? So, I get a lot of private
[00:04:13] time with with CEOs to really reflect
[00:04:16] and that's helped me a lot in my own my
[00:04:18] own journey as a CEO.
[00:04:20] >> You've worked for some legends, uh,
[00:04:22] Lloyd Blankfine, Hank Pollson. Did they
[00:04:26] mentor or coach you? Is there things you
[00:04:28] took from them that were incredibly
[00:04:31] valuable that all of us can learn from?
[00:04:33] >> I learned a lot from both of them. And
[00:04:34] you learned different. They they they
[00:04:35] had different skills. They had different
[00:04:37] personalities. into different things.
[00:04:38] Lloyd was an incredible risk manager, an
[00:04:40] incredible risk manager, and he had a he
[00:04:43] had an incredible ability to really
[00:04:48] sweat and worry about the things that
[00:04:49] had a small probability of happening.
[00:04:52] But boy oh boy, the fact that he was
[00:04:55] that way when we went into the financial
[00:04:56] crisis, you know, he was two steps ahead
[00:04:59] a lot of other uh a lot of other bank
[00:05:01] CEOs and I think was really
[00:05:03] extraordinary as a risk manager in that
[00:05:04] context. You know, Hank Hank was Hank
[00:05:09] was driven. He had a great nose for
[00:05:12] client relationships and how to get
[00:05:14] things done. And Hank also, you know,
[00:05:17] Hank had an incredible compass. And you
[00:05:20] know, one of the things that I
[00:05:21] definitely
[00:05:21] >> What do you mean by that?
[00:05:23] >> He believe he we all need a compass, you
[00:05:26] know, in these jobs and you want that
[00:05:28] compass pointing north. And one of the
[00:05:30] complicated things about being a CEO is
[00:05:32] there are a whole lot of things that are
[00:05:33] constantly banging on you trying to
[00:05:35] knock your compass off of north. And
[00:05:37] sometimes it takes enormous, you know,
[00:05:40] resilience and determination to keep
[00:05:41] that compass keep it pointed in the
[00:05:43] direction that you know is right while
[00:05:45] there's a lot of noise or agida. And you
[00:05:48] know, one of the things I learned from
[00:05:50] Hank and I just remember I remember
[00:05:52] sitting in a meeting with him, you know,
[00:05:54] early on when I was at Goldman Sachs and
[00:05:56] somebody was suggesting something and
[00:05:58] there was a lot of momentum for it and
[00:05:59] he just said, "Well, we're not going to
[00:06:01] do that."
[00:06:02] >> Okay.
[00:06:02] >> And it was completely against it was
[00:06:05] completely against kind of the consensus
[00:06:06] of the room and he was he was being a
[00:06:08] CEO because he thought it was wrong. He
[00:06:09] said, "We're not going to do that."
[00:06:10] >> And so I you know I think it's um I
[00:06:13] think you can learn from a lot of
[00:06:14] people. I had a great mentor who wasn't
[00:06:16] a CEO who actually you know if you would
[00:06:19] if you would frame the question around
[00:06:21] who's the most important mentor
[00:06:23] >> you've had in your career was a
[00:06:24] gentleman named Richie Metric okay
[00:06:26] >> who I worked for at Bear Sterns in the
[00:06:28] 1990s been the CFO of Interstate
[00:06:32] Bakeries he'd been a lawyer
[00:06:34] >> he was also just intuitively one of the
[00:06:36] smartest people I've ever met in my
[00:06:38] career and I've met a lot of smart
[00:06:39] people but he had a profound impact on
[00:06:43] teaching me at a time when I was in my
[00:06:45] late 20s and my early 30s and I was kind
[00:06:48] of rising up in an organization
[00:06:49] relatively quickly. He really taught me
[00:06:53] to be self-reflective and really
[00:06:55] understand strengths and weaknesses
[00:06:59] >> and you know be pretty hard on myself
[00:07:00] about things that I had to change
[00:07:02] >> if I wanted to advance. He forced me to
[00:07:04] look at myself at a time where I had,
[00:07:06] you know, less maturity, less of an
[00:07:08] ability to really I was just going
[00:07:10] >> and he for forced me to pause and really
[00:07:12] think about myself and how I could make
[00:07:14] myself better. And he had a profound had
[00:07:16] a profound impact on me.
[00:07:17] >> Okay. Interesting. There's it's a little
[00:07:19] bit fashionable in Silicon Valley these
[00:07:21] days that people are saying you got a
[00:07:24] much better return on your investment by
[00:07:26] investing in your strengths and making
[00:07:28] them stronger versus fixing your
[00:07:30] weaknesses and you should just hire
[00:07:32] around your weaknesses. Any reaction to
[00:07:34] that? I I think to be successful over a
[00:07:40] very very long career where you're going
[00:07:42] to be in leadership positions and
[00:07:43] ultimately rise up to lead a big
[00:07:47] organization. And by the way, it's very
[00:07:49] different from a founder leads an
[00:07:50] organization because they created it.
[00:07:52] >> Yes.
[00:07:52] >> And they anoint themselves founder. It's
[00:07:55] theirs.
[00:07:55] >> Yes.
[00:07:57] you know, rising up to lead a 150-y old
[00:07:59] organization like Goldman Sachs,
[00:08:03] >> you better have a lot of strengths, you
[00:08:05] better be working on your weaknesses,
[00:08:07] okay?
[00:08:07] >> Because if you're not doing all of the
[00:08:09] above, first of all, it's a random walk
[00:08:11] to begin with because there's so many
[00:08:13] talented people. And you know, one of
[00:08:14] the things I've always talked about is
[00:08:15] serendipity and timing.
[00:08:17] >> Um, and I think serendipity and timing
[00:08:20] have a lot to do with who winds up in
[00:08:21] the in the CEO jobs in these in these
[00:08:23] organizations.
[00:08:25] Um, but I think you better be working on
[00:08:28] the, you know, the whole package if you
[00:08:30] want to put yourself into the ring and
[00:08:32] have a chance to, uh, to come out of the
[00:08:34] ring. Got it.
[00:08:34] >> To come to come out of the ring.
[00:08:36] >> Another kind of
[00:08:39] something floating in the air in Silicon
[00:08:41] Valley is founders really hiring for
[00:08:45] slope versus experience. So, the very
[00:08:48] young, very intelligent, high slope
[00:08:51] person versus someone who's sort of been
[00:08:53] there and done that. Um, and you talked
[00:08:56] earlier about about just smart and and I
[00:09:00] it reminds me um I'm a Boston sports fan
[00:09:04] and the in the Boston Celtics have an
[00:09:06] announcer named Tommy Heinson and Tommy
[00:09:08] Heinson very announcer. He was really
[00:09:11] good. And the Celtics had like a backup
[00:09:14] backup center who was very low skill but
[00:09:18] was giant. And I remember Heinstein
[00:09:20] saying, you know, he may not have a lot
[00:09:23] of skill, but you can't teach seven
[00:09:25] feet. And I kind of think the same with
[00:09:27] smart. You can't teach smart. So, how
[00:09:30] much is it about smart versus
[00:09:32] experience? I kind of think you guys are
[00:09:33] famous for hiring very bright young
[00:09:36] people and moving them up. We're we're
[00:09:38] as an organization, we're
[00:09:39] extraordinarily lucky that we have so
[00:09:41] many incredibly bright people that are
[00:09:43] interested in working and spending time
[00:09:45] at Goldman Sachs. But,
[00:09:46] >> you know, I'm I'm in the camp of smart
[00:09:49] enough.
[00:09:50] >> Okay.
[00:09:51] Um, you have to be smart enough,
[00:09:55] but the smartest person in the world
[00:09:57] without a whole package of other things
[00:10:00] not going to navigate Goldman Sachs
[00:10:01] well. Not going to be successful in
[00:10:03] Goldman Sachs, you know, over the over
[00:10:05] the, um, over the long run.
[00:10:07] >> You know, the human elements,
[00:10:09] um, the ability to connect, resilience,
[00:10:14] >> determination,
[00:10:16] striving for excellence, you know,
[00:10:18] things that matter, you know,
[00:10:19] everywhere.
[00:10:20] It's interesting when you talk, you
[00:10:22] know, you live in a founder world.
[00:10:24] >> I live in an established company world
[00:10:26] and I deal with founders as clients.
[00:10:28] But,
[00:10:29] >> you know, it's um, you know, this this
[00:10:31] this concept of of slope versus
[00:10:34] experience. I live in a world where
[00:10:36] experience is worth a lot. I live in a
[00:10:38] world, if you sit around the management
[00:10:40] committee table at Goldman Sachs,
[00:10:43] >> the level of experience and the judgment
[00:10:46] that comes from that experience is
[00:10:47] extraordinary. underrated in your mind.
[00:10:50] >> And and hugely underrated. And by the
[00:10:52] way, hugely necessary kind of big
[00:10:53] differentiator for the firm.
[00:10:55] >> Okay.
[00:10:55] >> Um you can't you can't teach experience.
[00:10:59] >> No,
[00:10:59] >> that doesn't mean somebody without
[00:11:01] experience can't do very very well. But
[00:11:04] it's you know it's
[00:11:05] >> I mean someone can't watch this podcast
[00:11:06] and then run Goldman Sachs and not be
[00:11:08] able to do it.
[00:11:09] >> Well, a lot of people there are a lot of
[00:11:11] people that can run Goldman Sachs and
[00:11:12] maybe if they do they'll have less bumps
[00:11:14] and bruises than I do. But um
[00:11:16] >> you know experience experience matters
[00:11:18] in these big organizations and when it
[00:11:20] matters it doesn't matter when things
[00:11:21] are going well.
[00:11:23] >> It matters when the bumps come.
[00:11:25] >> Yeah.
[00:11:25] >> Um and you know you've got to make
[00:11:27] difficult judgments and and making those
[00:11:29] judgments and and they're not they're
[00:11:31] not 9010 judgments. They're 5149
[00:11:33] judgments.
[00:11:34] >> No easy decisions at the CEO desk.
[00:11:36] >> By the way, if it's an easy decision, it
[00:11:37] doesn't make it to my desk. One of the
[00:11:39] things I've realized is I don't have to
[00:11:40] make a lot of decisions.
[00:11:41] >> What's the best of two shitty options?
[00:11:43] >> Yeah. where that is that is oftentimes
[00:11:45] what CEOs face.
[00:11:46] >> Yeah.
[00:11:47] >> Okay. A lot of people listening are VP
[00:11:50] of such and such in XYZ scaleup company
[00:11:54] and they want to be CEO of a company
[00:11:57] someday. Um you were kind of hired from
[00:12:01] the outside, you rose up to CEO. Advice
[00:12:03] to those folks who are on that kind of
[00:12:05] track who want to be not found a company
[00:12:07] but become a CEO. And I think basic in
[00:12:10] tech a lot of companies are getting
[00:12:11] older and a lot of founders are going to
[00:12:13] step aside in the next few years and a
[00:12:15] new generation will kind of come up and
[00:12:17] take over them. Advice for those folks.
[00:12:20] What was a younger David thinking about
[00:12:22] back then?
[00:12:22] >> Well, I think I think one of the things
[00:12:26] that's interesting when I was you know I
[00:12:29] joined Goldman Sachs at 37. I had I had
[00:12:31] actually I had worked early in my career
[00:12:33] at Drexel Burnham and then Drexel
[00:12:34] Bernham went out of business and I wound
[00:12:36] up at Bear Sterns and I did very well at
[00:12:38] Beer Sterns. I rose up into a relatively
[00:12:40] senior position at Bear Sterns in my
[00:12:42] mid30s.
[00:12:44] And when I joined Goldman Sachs, I
[00:12:46] certainly did not aspire to be the CEO
[00:12:49] of Goldman Sachs. You know, I aspired to
[00:12:52] to practice the trade of investment
[00:12:54] banking, be super successful at it,
[00:12:56] impact the organization.
[00:12:57] >> Yeah.
[00:12:58] >> I I decided that I was a big
[00:13:00] organization person.
[00:13:01] >> Okay.
[00:13:01] >> Um,
[00:13:02] >> what do you mean by that?
[00:13:03] >> I I loved, you know, there's a dynamic
[00:13:06] in a large organization. the resources,
[00:13:08] the access, the platform that I found
[00:13:12] very very appealing and the leadership
[00:13:14] opportunity, you know, in big platforms.
[00:13:16] I found that very very appealing. So I
[00:13:18] was leading, you know, in my 30s at Bear
[00:13:20] Stories, but then at Goldman Sachs, you
[00:13:22] know, I was managing hundreds and
[00:13:23] hundreds of people. Yeah. Um, very
[00:13:25] quickly, thousands of people.
[00:13:27] >> Um, and I really I enjoyed that. I
[00:13:30] enjoyed the platform. I enjoyed being a
[00:13:32] part of an institution. It wasn't about
[00:13:33] me. It was about, you know, stewarding
[00:13:36] >> Yeah.
[00:13:36] >> stewarding the institution. I really I
[00:13:38] really enjoyed that.
[00:13:40] >> But I never, my goal wasn't to be the
[00:13:42] CEO of Goldman Sachs. In fact, I I
[00:13:45] >> in some ways I'm the unlikely CEO. Okay.
[00:13:47] >> Um I came from the outside. I was never,
[00:13:50] you know, you can go back and you can
[00:13:51] look at some articles, you know, the
[00:13:53] dark horse candidate this the unlike. I
[00:13:55] mean, a lot of it serendipity, a lot of
[00:13:57] it's luck, but it wasn't it wasn't my
[00:13:58] principal goal. Now, at the same time, I
[00:14:01] just told you that I liked leading
[00:14:03] people. And so, I knew I was developing
[00:14:06] skills that gave me the possibility of
[00:14:10] leading a organization. But what I was
[00:14:13] focused on was developing skills and
[00:14:16] seeing where the road took me, not kind
[00:14:19] of pointing to a seat and saying, "How
[00:14:20] do I get to that seat?"
[00:14:21] >> Yeah.
[00:14:22] >> Um, and so my advice to people that
[00:14:25] really want to run a big enterprise,
[00:14:27] Yeah. is you've got to do a lot of
[00:14:28] different things. So, one of the great
[00:14:31] benefits that I got at Goldman Sachs is
[00:14:33] I did a lot of different things.
[00:14:34] >> They moved you around.
[00:14:35] >> They moved me around and I, you know, I
[00:14:37] was I was running all of credit trading
[00:14:39] when I joined the firm. Yeah.
[00:14:40] >> And then Hank Paulson came and said to
[00:14:42] me, "You're going to go run equity
[00:14:43] capital markets." And I said, "Well, I
[00:14:44] really like this job." And he said, "No,
[00:14:46] you're going to go do this."
[00:14:47] >> Yeah.
[00:14:48] >> Um, and so it was it was a completely
[00:14:50] different thing.
[00:14:51] >> Do you think startups should do that?
[00:14:52] They've got a high potential person move
[00:14:53] even though they're great in moving the
[00:14:56] needle in what they are doing. Should
[00:14:58] they have rotation type?
[00:14:59] >> It's harder. It's harder. It's harder in
[00:15:00] a startup.
[00:15:01] >> Yeah.
[00:15:01] >> Okay. It's harder in a startup because
[00:15:02] you you have you have a limited number
[00:15:04] of people do again big enterprises and
[00:15:07] platforms. This is one of the things
[00:15:09] that's really attractive about working
[00:15:10] at a big enterprise like Goldman Sachs.
[00:15:12] You can move around and do a lot of
[00:15:14] things. Yeah.
[00:15:15] >> And a startup that's trying to scale in
[00:15:16] a business,
[00:15:17] >> you know, you don't you don't have that
[00:15:19] same luxury. you you can't you can't the
[00:15:22] organization can't be as patient you
[00:15:24] know to some degree so they they really
[00:15:26] are they really are different things but
[00:15:28] if you want to lead if you want to
[00:15:30] really lead people and lead big parts of
[00:15:31] organizations or ultimately lead an
[00:15:33] organization
[00:15:34] >> I think you've got to try to do a
[00:15:36] variety of different things and really
[00:15:37] gain experience
[00:15:38] >> do you think failure is important along
[00:15:40] that road
[00:15:40] >> I I think failure is important for
[00:15:42] everyone because you know there's
[00:15:44] there's no one
[00:15:46] >> do you feel like man I fell on my face
[00:15:47] on the way
[00:15:48] >> I I mean I fell on my
[00:15:50] you know, so many times. I mean, so many
[00:15:51] times and I I can tell you, you know,
[00:15:54] crazy stories about being, you know,
[00:15:55] really learning what it is, you know, to
[00:15:57] be responsible things. Goldman Sachs is
[00:16:00] a very competitive place. We compete to
[00:16:02] a very high standard. I I mean, here's a
[00:16:04] small, you know, anecdotal story. It was
[00:16:07] uh I I was over I had flown over to
[00:16:11] Ireland to play golf for three days with
[00:16:14] a group of guys I went to college with
[00:16:17] because it was the year when we all
[00:16:18] turned 40.
[00:16:20] >> And I had just started running the
[00:16:23] equity capital markets business at
[00:16:24] Goldman Sachs. And when I when you know
[00:16:28] we got over there um and that night
[00:16:32] we're having dinner and this is you know
[00:16:34] cell phones existed but it wasn't the
[00:16:36] same constant text and everybody in
[00:16:39] touch but I checked my message after
[00:16:41] dinner so it would have been uh you know
[00:16:44] 10:30 at night so it's going to be 5:30
[00:16:46] in New York.
[00:16:48] We had missed a $2 billion equity deal
[00:16:51] for uh for Accenture and people were
[00:16:55] going apoplelectic as how it could
[00:16:57] happen because we had led their IPO, you
[00:16:59] know, a year earlier and we missed this
[00:17:01] $2 billion equity deal.
[00:17:03] >> And you know what, my area, I was
[00:17:04] responsible. I was figuring out how to
[00:17:06] get myself back to New York. I was back
[00:17:07] in the office the next morning dealing
[00:17:10] with it. And it's, you know, that's you
[00:17:12] learn from those things. Yeah. Okay.
[00:17:13] Because the world was like, "Okay,
[00:17:15] you're in charge. How could this happen
[00:17:16] on your watch? Now I tell the story now
[00:17:19] it's 25 years later it's one deal but
[00:17:22] that ethos of competing to that level of
[00:17:25] excellence that level of accountability
[00:17:27] those are things that have really made
[00:17:29] Goldman Sachs what it is over a long
[00:17:31] period of time and if you want to lead
[00:17:32] in that organization
[00:17:34] >> you know you have to when when things
[00:17:36] don't go right you have to run to them
[00:17:37] and you have to jump on them and so I
[00:17:39] mean that's happened so many different
[00:17:40] times in my career different ways
[00:17:42] different things
[00:17:43] >> bad judgments on people chose the wrong
[00:17:46] people had to correct
[00:17:48] Mhm.
[00:17:48] >> By the way, I mean, one of the most
[00:17:50] difficult decisions I made was for us to
[00:17:52] step away from some of the consumer
[00:17:54] business that we had started.
[00:17:55] >> Yeah, let's talk about that.
[00:17:56] >> Yeah. Um,
[00:17:58] >> that I don't think that was your bet.
[00:18:00] >> Well, I didn't I didn't start it. I, you
[00:18:01] know, I I didn't start it. The the the
[00:18:03] theision
[00:18:05] roll back the history a little bit. So,
[00:18:06] it's
[00:18:07] >> Sure.
[00:18:07] >> The thing that I find interesting about
[00:18:09] it after running HubSpot is like you've
[00:18:10] got your core businesses. They're going
[00:18:12] great. It's like and they're big markets
[00:18:15] and you're you're deep in the markets.
[00:18:17] Should we just triple down on that or
[00:18:19] should we take a risk and do something
[00:18:20] new is one question in my head I always
[00:18:24] wrestle that. The second question is
[00:18:25] okay we did that bet. It's going okay
[00:18:31] if we just put enough resource on it
[00:18:33] would work. And so the decision to go
[00:18:35] into it I think is interesting. And the
[00:18:37] decision, I'm sure you doubled down a
[00:18:39] couple times about the decision to step
[00:18:40] away. That's fascinating to me.
[00:18:43] >> Well, there there are a couple things. I
[00:18:45] mean, it's it's it's a complex story as
[00:18:47] these things always are. And and
[00:18:50] >> you know, there's a there's a press
[00:18:52] narrative around it that
[00:18:53] >> what's the real narrative?
[00:18:54] >> Well, the reason that we the reason that
[00:18:56] we there are a number of reasons why we
[00:18:58] decided to move into the business, but a
[00:19:00] big reason we decided to look at the
[00:19:03] business was to start to build a deposit
[00:19:05] platform.
[00:19:05] >> Yeah. because the firm was the largest
[00:19:07] wholesale funer in the world and there
[00:19:09] are a lot of things that you want to be
[00:19:10] the largest in the world. Wholesale
[00:19:12] funer as a financial institution is not
[00:19:14] one of them.
[00:19:14] >> Okay.
[00:19:15] >> Okay.
[00:19:16] >> So, you know, deposits represent, you
[00:19:19] know, a much more stable base and
[00:19:20] because we hadn't grown up as a bank. We
[00:19:22] did not have a deposit platform and
[00:19:24] digitization was allowing the concept of
[00:19:26] digital deposits. And so the original
[00:19:28] idea was we'll build a digital deposit
[00:19:30] platform and we'll we'll make some
[00:19:33] consumer loans and we'll see what we can
[00:19:36] create out of it.
[00:19:36] >> Was this bubbling under the surface for
[00:19:38] a year 10 years?
[00:19:40] >> No, there was there was there was a very
[00:19:41] famous meeting out in the east end of
[00:19:44] Long Island at Gary Cohen's house who
[00:19:45] was the president with a group of the
[00:19:47] senior leaders brainstorm. Yeah.
[00:19:49] Brainstorming around growth ideas that
[00:19:52] would move the firm forward. This was
[00:19:54] this was surfaced by by a couple of
[00:19:56] other people. not me, a couple other
[00:19:57] people there. I was running investment
[00:19:58] banking at the time and Lloyd decided
[00:20:01] that that he wanted to do it and then
[00:20:03] shortly after we started that
[00:20:07] um Apple approached us as to whether or
[00:20:10] not we wanted to look at partnering with
[00:20:12] them on a credit card and I think you
[00:20:14] know there the thought process was one
[00:20:17] of the largest most important companies
[00:20:18] in the world you know if you're going to
[00:20:20] do this very interesting partner very
[00:20:22] interesting tech partner and so a
[00:20:25] decision was made that we'd go down that
[00:20:26] road we'd try to do it And one of the
[00:20:28] reasons we were attracted to Apple is
[00:20:29] Apple wanted to do it differently.
[00:20:31] >> Hold on, let me stop you there. You're
[00:20:33] you're in Long Island. You're having
[00:20:35] that discussion. A couple guys present
[00:20:37] it.
[00:20:38] >> And was there a lot of debate around it?
[00:20:41] How does Goldman make a decision like
[00:20:42] that? Is it is it consensus? Were there
[00:20:45] a bunch of people in the room said,
[00:20:46] "Hey, this is crazy." There was a lot of
[00:20:47] debate and there were a lot of people
[00:20:49] offering opinions, but ultimately
[00:20:51] >> the decision to launch the the deposit
[00:20:53] platform and um and start the small
[00:20:56] lending business that we called Marcus
[00:20:58] ultimately was Lloyd's call.
[00:20:59] >> Okay.
[00:20:59] >> Yeah. And that's
[00:21:00] >> and was it contrarian to what the room
[00:21:02] generally wanted?
[00:21:03] >> No, it wasn't it wasn't contrary
[00:21:04] although there were people like why
[00:21:06] would we do this? But I I think the
[00:21:08] deposit thing was a really important
[00:21:09] strategic decision. I think that was
[00:21:11] right. And then how did you decide you
[00:21:14] didn't have any experience in that who
[00:21:16] to give that opportunity to as opposed
[00:21:18] to acquiring in the space? Here's here's
[00:21:20] where I think, you know, and this is all
[00:21:23] hindsight, you know, and hindsight's
[00:21:24] very easy, obviously, because with
[00:21:26] hindsight, you know, you're going to be
[00:21:27] mostly right.
[00:21:28] >> Mostly
[00:21:28] >> I think I think one of the um I think
[00:21:31] one of the big mistakes we made, this is
[00:21:34] a little bit culture, and I've I've
[00:21:36] tried to evolve this a little bit. The
[00:21:38] firm always
[00:21:40] operated as we did new things and we
[00:21:43] grew the firm that we've got lots of
[00:21:44] smart people and we can figure it out.
[00:21:46] It was very insular. There was never a
[00:21:49] view that you know let's go get real
[00:21:52] expertise from the outside.
[00:21:54] >> Now that evolved a little bit by the way
[00:21:57] that's one of the reasons why I wound up
[00:21:58] at the firm
[00:21:59] >> um because I had an expertise that there
[00:22:01] wasn't there wasn't it wasn't expertise
[00:22:04] that was heavily embedded in the firm.
[00:22:06] Um but um
[00:22:09] but I think with hindsight we would have
[00:22:10] been better if we really wanted
[00:22:12] strategically to be in that business to
[00:22:13] buy a more established platform instead
[00:22:15] of starting from scratch. Now what's
[00:22:17] also lost in the story and the narrative
[00:22:20] is we built some very very good things.
[00:22:22] First of all the deposit platform is
[00:22:23] very big and very successful and the
[00:22:26] firm is enormous benefits from the fact
[00:22:28] that we have this digital deposit
[00:22:30] platform. Enormous benefits and that's
[00:22:33] worth a lot a lot of money. Yeah.
[00:22:35] >> Um and it's very important for the
[00:22:36] firm's funding and the way the firm is
[00:22:38] competitively positioned.
[00:22:40] credit card platform with Apple is an
[00:22:42] extraordinary product and service. And
[00:22:45] you know, while it's it's out in the
[00:22:46] world that we're not going to be a
[00:22:48] long-term Yeah.
[00:22:49] >> you know, holder of that, it's something
[00:22:51] that we built with Apple. Yeah.
[00:22:53] >> That is really terrific. It's the And
[00:22:55] it's it's a great product. It's a great
[00:22:57] service and it's really working now. So,
[00:23:00] what prompted the decision? The decision
[00:23:03] was prompted by the fact that the
[00:23:05] regulatory environment had significantly
[00:23:08] changed. We and other financial
[00:23:11] institutions were dealing with
[00:23:13] regulatory changes and it became very
[00:23:15] hard to organically scale that to a
[00:23:18] place I see
[00:23:19] >> that you could really make it work.
[00:23:21] >> The firm was feeling some pressure
[00:23:23] because it was a tough time after the
[00:23:25] Russian invasion of Ukraine and asset
[00:23:27] prices in 2022. We had a lot of
[00:23:30] regulatory pressure and
[00:23:33] you know a group of us in the senior
[00:23:35] leadership said this is not working. We
[00:23:37] can make it work, but it's going to be
[00:23:38] very, very hard. But it's small and it's
[00:23:42] distracting us from the things that can
[00:23:43] really create significant market cap and
[00:23:46] value. And so we made the tough decision
[00:23:49] to park it. It was a tough call. But
[00:23:51] there's also a very a lot of attention
[00:23:54] on it, unfortunately, for such a small
[00:23:55] thing.
[00:23:56] >> I mean, if you if you really go back and
[00:23:57] think about it, you know, the firm was
[00:23:59] doing well.
[00:24:00] >> Yeah. And this was less than 5% of the
[00:24:03] firm's revenues.
[00:24:05] >> And it was getting attention as though
[00:24:06] it was 40% of the firm's revenues and
[00:24:08] 40% of the firm's capital.
[00:24:10] >> But that affected the decision because
[00:24:12] it was distracting from the progress we
[00:24:15] were making in other things.
[00:24:17] >> You know, in the long run, it may or may
[00:24:20] not have been in the broad breath of
[00:24:22] what Goldman Sachs will become over the
[00:24:24] next 50 years the right decision, but it
[00:24:27] was definitely the right decision for
[00:24:28] that time. and it helped clarify the
[00:24:31] focus of the firm and get the attention
[00:24:33] back on to all the good things the firm
[00:24:34] was doing. And I think we've benefited
[00:24:36] enormously the last few years, you know,
[00:24:38] from that.
[00:24:38] >> You just talk about that decision like
[00:24:40] CEOs face that type of decision all the
[00:24:43] time of like should we double down or
[00:24:45] should we just pull the band-aid off and
[00:24:47] pull out? Um was that bubbling for a
[00:24:52] couple months, a couple years? Was there
[00:24:55] another group saying, "Hey, we just need
[00:24:57] to double down and get the right people.
[00:24:58] is going to work. Can you just kind of
[00:24:59] take us in the room and take us inside
[00:25:01] your It was a very tough call you made.
[00:25:03] >> You know, one of the things about
[00:25:04] Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs has been a
[00:25:05] partnership for 140 years. And I think
[00:25:08] one of the things that you know that as
[00:25:11] a leadership team we're most proud of
[00:25:14] over the last over the last seven years
[00:25:17] um is that we've really kind of
[00:25:20] completed the journey to really getting
[00:25:22] the leadership the broad leadership the
[00:25:25] partnership because we still have this
[00:25:26] concept of partnership
[00:25:27] >> really focused
[00:25:29] >> on delivering for shareholders and we're
[00:25:31] fully making the transition from kind of
[00:25:34] being a public company but still
[00:25:36] operating more like a distributed
[00:25:37] partnership ship versus now really being
[00:25:39] a public company and really working for
[00:25:41] the whole of the company
[00:25:42] >> and um you know that that that was a
[00:25:45] tough thing to manage. So when whenever
[00:25:48] you know whenever there are headwinds at
[00:25:49] Goldman Sachs
[00:25:51] people get very critical of anything
[00:25:53] that's not working because they see it
[00:25:54] as affecting them.
[00:25:56] >> Yeah.
[00:25:56] >> You know very directly. I think we're in
[00:25:59] a better place in terms of how you know
[00:26:02] we operate around that all but there was
[00:26:04] a lot of pressure from people in the
[00:26:05] organization that thought that it was
[00:26:07] going to cost you know them money in the
[00:26:10] short term
[00:26:11] >> but that that really wasn't weighing
[00:26:14] what was what was weighing was the fact
[00:26:17] that I still think there was a belief I
[00:26:20] knew I had a belief that with a much
[00:26:23] longer term lens we were doing something
[00:26:25] that could be very interesting and
[00:26:27] really give the firm another leg of
[00:26:29] growth.
[00:26:30] >> Yeah.
[00:26:31] >> But I knew that it was going to be very
[00:26:34] rough to get there given both the
[00:26:36] regulatory environment and the current
[00:26:38] market environment and just where kind
[00:26:39] of the
[00:26:40] >> the culture of the firm felt. And so,
[00:26:43] you know, went and talked to the board
[00:26:46] and the board's initial response was no,
[00:26:48] no, no, no, no. Okay.
[00:26:49] >> Yeah. No, no, no, no, no.
[00:26:51] >> And, you know, we we talked about it and
[00:26:53] we worked through it over
[00:26:54] >> one meeting or is this over
[00:26:56] >> over a few months? I see.
[00:26:57] >> Over a few months. I mean, I, you know,
[00:26:59] I was over multiple board meetings, but
[00:27:00] it was over, it was over a few months,
[00:27:02] >> but um, you know, I look back at
[00:27:04] decisions I've had to make. That was
[00:27:09] in some ways that was the hardest
[00:27:11] decision. In other ways, as as a team we
[00:27:14] did the work and we talked about it, it
[00:27:16] became an easier decision because it
[00:27:18] became clear this was going to be the
[00:27:19] right thing for the firm at this time.
[00:27:22] >> Okay. A lot of start I work with a lot
[00:27:24] of these hot AI startups and they all
[00:27:27] want to partner with whoever with open
[00:27:30] AI with Apple with SAP with you name it.
[00:27:33] My company partnered with Google and
[00:27:35] Salesforce you partner with Apple. Um
[00:27:39] advice on dancing with giants.
[00:27:44] >> Well, you know Apple obviously is a
[00:27:47] bigger company than Goldman Sachs.
[00:27:48] Goldman Sachs is no peanut startup. Um,
[00:27:51] and so I would say
[00:27:54] >> but big companies I would say partners
[00:27:56] would say there was more I that's that's
[00:27:58] exactly where I was go. I would say it
[00:27:59] was more of a peer relationship
[00:28:02] >> but partnerships between companies are
[00:28:04] tough.
[00:28:05] >> And you know what I would say to you
[00:28:09] know accelerating or scaling up young
[00:28:11] companies that want to partner with
[00:28:14] these you know these big platforms
[00:28:16] you know most partnerships don't work.
[00:28:19] >> Yeah. And
[00:28:22] there better be really compelling, you
[00:28:24] know, glue to that partnership or, you
[00:28:27] know, chances of it working or low. I
[00:28:30] mean, the you and I know, I mean, you
[00:28:32] partnerships are hard. Yeah,
[00:28:33] >> partnerships are very hard.
[00:28:34] Organizations have different cultures,
[00:28:36] different expectations, and partnerships
[00:28:38] are very, very hard. Now, that doesn't
[00:28:39] mean there aren't some great
[00:28:40] partnerships.
[00:28:42] Um, but to have them really work, you've
[00:28:44] got to have really good alignment of
[00:28:47] incentives, of purpose, of incentives,
[00:28:50] >> and a governance structure that can
[00:28:51] assure that the, for lack of a better
[00:28:54] term, the friction in each organization
[00:28:56] doesn't doesn't make it harder for those
[00:28:59] for that partnership to move forward.
[00:29:01] >> I'm just going to go back a minute ago.
[00:29:02] You talked about solving for
[00:29:03] shareholders
[00:29:05] and I I talked to founders and some
[00:29:08] founders like there's three constituents
[00:29:10] that you can solve for. You really
[00:29:11] double down on the shareholders or
[00:29:13] really double down the employees or
[00:29:14] really double down on your customers.
[00:29:17] Where does where's sort of Goldman's
[00:29:20] energy? Um where's your energy on that?
[00:29:23] I'm not gonna let you off the hook and
[00:29:24] say all three. Well, I I you don't have
[00:29:27] to you don't have to let me off the
[00:29:28] hook, but I'll I'll talk about a couple
[00:29:31] of things of the way I think about it.
[00:29:33] >> Okay?
[00:29:33] >> So, first of all, for any business,
[00:29:35] >> okay, if you don't have a product or
[00:29:38] service that you're selling to somebody
[00:29:40] that is value ad, you don't have a
[00:29:42] business.
[00:29:43] >> Okay? So, let's just start with whether
[00:29:45] it's clients or it's customers or it's
[00:29:47] fine,
[00:29:48] >> you know. So, what is true north for
[00:29:50] Goldman Sachs? True North for Goldman
[00:29:51] Sachs is client.
[00:29:53] You know, we know
[00:29:54] >> it sounds like investors have a loud
[00:29:56] voice.
[00:29:57] >> Well, investors do have a loud voice.
[00:29:59] We'll come to that in a second. But just
[00:30:00] if I if I finish this if I finish this
[00:30:02] thought,
[00:30:03] >> you know, client centricity is true
[00:30:06] north. It's one of the firm's four core
[00:30:08] values.
[00:30:08] >> Okay.
[00:30:10] >> Client service, partnership, integrity,
[00:30:13] excellence, four core values. But client
[00:30:15] service,
[00:30:17] client centricity is kind of true north.
[00:30:20] And the general ethos of the firm is if
[00:30:22] you build trust with clients, if you
[00:30:24] take a long-term view, if you do the
[00:30:26] right thing,
[00:30:27] >> good things will happen.
[00:30:29] >> It's a long game, good things will
[00:30:30] happen. And I I've watched that in my
[00:30:32] career and I believe it deeply.
[00:30:35] >> Really deeply. Now, if good things
[00:30:38] happen with clients and our business,
[00:30:40] good things happen for shareholders. And
[00:30:44] you can't be confused. If you are not
[00:30:46] delivering for shareholders, you're not
[00:30:48] going to be able to do good things for
[00:30:49] clients because what do we deliver? What
[00:30:52] do we deliver to clients? We devote
[00:30:53] people, capital, and technology. And we
[00:30:57] marry those things together. And you
[00:31:00] know, if you're not performing for
[00:31:01] shareholders, your ability to have the
[00:31:03] resources and the capability to be
[00:31:04] really good for your clients gets
[00:31:06] limited.
[00:31:07] >> Now, here's the tricky thing. In our
[00:31:08] business, we have to have extraordinary
[00:31:11] people in our business to be able to do
[00:31:12] any of this for shareholders or for
[00:31:14] clients. So, I don't want to go back to
[00:31:16] you're not going to let me do it, but I
[00:31:18] need to I need I need to I need to
[00:31:20] deliver for all three. Okay. And it's
[00:31:22] almost like it's almost like as a
[00:31:23] leadership team, it's kind of like we're
[00:31:25] conducting an orchestra, and we've got
[00:31:27] to, you know, conduct the orchestra
[00:31:28] between, you know, clients, people,
[00:31:31] shareholders, and we've got to make it
[00:31:33] all sound beautiful. And and at the
[00:31:35] moment, we're going through a period
[00:31:36] where it really does sound beautiful,
[00:31:38] and I kind of like that. But I've also
[00:31:40] been through other periods where it kind
[00:31:42] of sounded like something was out of
[00:31:43] tune. And then you've got to you got to
[00:31:45] figure out how to get back into balance.
[00:31:46] >> Okay, speaking of orchestras, like I had
[00:31:48] an old boss that used to say, "We're not
[00:31:50] an orchestra, we're a jazz band." Um,
[00:31:52] and I work with all these founders that
[00:31:54] they're in 40 person companies going to
[00:31:56] 400, going to 4,000, going to 40,000.
[00:32:00] And they're it slows everything slows
[00:32:03] down as they get bigger. And man, they
[00:32:06] complain about it. Uh, and they always
[00:32:09] ask me like, "Brian, how do I how do I
[00:32:11] keep the speed and the intensity and the
[00:32:13] missionary zeal as we go from 40 to 400
[00:32:16] to 4,000?" You seem to be moving pretty
[00:32:20] briskly for a 40,000 person or advice
[00:32:23] for these founders.
[00:32:25] >> Well, one of the things that's just
[00:32:26] interesting is I'm not scaling an
[00:32:29] organization from 4,000 to 40,000 to
[00:32:33] 400,000. you know, I inherited
[00:32:36] I I I stepped into my role with an
[00:32:39] organization that had about 36 or 38,000
[00:32:41] people. And today, you know, I'm I'm in
[00:32:44] the eighth year of my tenure, just
[00:32:47] started the eth year of my tenure,
[00:32:49] >> and we have, you know, 48 or 49,000.
[00:32:52] >> So, we've had nice growth.
[00:32:54] >> But, you know, the bigger thing is that
[00:32:55] we've taken the revenues from 34 billion
[00:32:58] kind of on average where they were in
[00:32:59] the last decade to kind of 55 to 60
[00:33:01] billion. And I think the market cap's
[00:33:03] four or 5x.
[00:33:04] >> Yeah, we've taken the market cap from 60
[00:33:06] 70 billion to 250 billion. So, we've
[00:33:09] done we've done a really
[00:33:10] >> we've done a really nice job at growing
[00:33:12] the firm.
[00:33:13] >> You know, the firm our firm scales
[00:33:17] there. There are businesses in our firm
[00:33:18] that scale with people, but there are a
[00:33:21] lot of businesses that scale with
[00:33:22] capital. And so, you know, one of the
[00:33:25] things I think we got really right that
[00:33:27] really helped our market shares,
[00:33:28] particularly in our core business, is we
[00:33:30] put more financial resources. We scaled
[00:33:32] more capital into the business and
[00:33:33] decided we were going to lean into
[00:33:35] providing more resources which
[00:33:37] generated, you know, more more return. I
[00:33:41] on this point though of of nimleness,
[00:33:43] you know, this all gets to culture and
[00:33:44] and and you know, one of the things that
[00:33:46] I think Goldman Sachs has been around
[00:33:48] for 155 years and there's been a lot
[00:33:50] said about Goldman Sachs's culture and
[00:33:52] Goldman Sachs's culture is unique, but I
[00:33:54] would also say it's constantly changing.
[00:33:57] >> And the most
[00:33:57] >> is that an intentional change or is it
[00:33:59] bottomup changing?
[00:34:00] >> It's it's both. I mean, it's both. But
[00:34:02] but here's the thing. you better be
[00:34:05] working at defining what you want it to
[00:34:06] be and constantly reshaping it and
[00:34:09] amplifying what you think really
[00:34:11] matters. And you know, I'll give you an
[00:34:12] example
[00:34:13] >> of something we did that I think just
[00:34:15] shows you how we think about this and
[00:34:17] why it's it's so so important.
[00:34:20] Co was awful for everybody,
[00:34:23] was awful for businesses, particularly
[00:34:26] awful for our business. Think about our
[00:34:28] business. We have 49,000 people. 50% of
[00:34:31] them are in their 20s. It is an
[00:34:32] apprenticeship culture. They're coming
[00:34:35] to the firm to spend time with people
[00:34:38] and all of a sudden the whole ecosystem
[00:34:40] is like often a different it's it's like
[00:34:44] you know we were we were on Earth now
[00:34:46] we're on Mars. Right. Okay.
[00:34:47] >> Right.
[00:34:48] >> And so you know in that in that context
[00:34:51] it frayed at our culture and there was a
[00:34:53] lot going on during that period of time
[00:34:55] was fraying at everybody's culture. But
[00:34:57] as soon as we got to a point which was
[00:34:59] like okay we're going to go move forward
[00:35:01] as a leadership team we said we have to
[00:35:05] kind of reinvest and reinvigorate our
[00:35:07] culture and here's what we decided to
[00:35:09] do. We said we're going to make a big
[00:35:10] investment in this. So there are 450
[00:35:12] Goldman Sachs partners. We said we are
[00:35:15] going to take the time to send during
[00:35:18] the course of a year. It ultimately took
[00:35:19] us 15 months. We're going to send all
[00:35:22] the partners off in groups of 25 offsite
[00:35:26] for two days to talk about the culture,
[00:35:29] what's important in the culture, and
[00:35:31] what their responsibility is to steward
[00:35:34] that culture. Okay. And reinvigorate it.
[00:35:36] And I committed to have a three-hour,
[00:35:39] four-h hour dinner with every single one
[00:35:41] of those cohorts over 15 months.
[00:35:42] >> Okay. How much weight did you gain
[00:35:44] during that time?
[00:35:44] >> I, you know, I tried to eat very little.
[00:35:46] And uh but but the point is, think about
[00:35:50] it. the most senior people of the firm.
[00:35:51] >> Yeah.
[00:35:53] >> All going away in cohorts of 25 to spend
[00:35:55] two days together. So offline for two
[00:35:57] days. The CEO committing to do 20
[00:36:00] dinners.
[00:36:01] >> Okay.
[00:36:02] >> It was a big commitment. You know what?
[00:36:04] We came out of that and the firm was
[00:36:06] aligned on what mattered culturally.
[00:36:08] Okay.
[00:36:09] >> And there were some changes and there
[00:36:10] were some, you know, nuance things, you
[00:36:12] know, still foundational values, but it
[00:36:15] was a kick in the pants to everybody.
[00:36:16] Hey, we own this. We have to steward it.
[00:36:18] We have to feel figure out in the new
[00:36:20] world that we're in how do we make this
[00:36:22] really exceptional so that all the
[00:36:24] things that make Goldman Sachs
[00:36:25] exceptional continue to be. And so one
[00:36:28] of the things that's just interesting
[00:36:29] when I when I talk to founders and
[00:36:31] startups they talk about their cultures.
[00:36:33] >> Okay. And the first thing going on in my
[00:36:34] mind is that's great but the company's
[00:36:37] been around for seven years. Okay.
[00:36:40] >> How do how do you find a culture in a
[00:36:42] company that's been around for seven
[00:36:43] years? How are you putting your mark on
[00:36:44] what it's going to be? What's it going
[00:36:46] to be at 15 years versus seven? It's a
[00:36:48] very different thing
[00:36:50] >> when you don't have you know that
[00:36:51] foundation but culture in all
[00:36:53] organizations requires commitment
[00:36:56] investment focus
[00:36:59] you know that that matters in all big
[00:37:02] small growing scaling established
[00:37:05] >> you know one or two things that came out
[00:37:06] of all those dinners in that big confab
[00:37:09] that were like we're this is what our
[00:37:12] culture is and this is where our culture
[00:37:13] isn't where there a couple of things
[00:37:15] that you're like this really changed Um
[00:37:18] I you know I think I think you know a
[00:37:20] recind of underwriting of what it meant
[00:37:23] to hold the organization to a standard
[00:37:25] of excellence. I see
[00:37:26] >> that that
[00:37:26] >> you felt that was slipping.
[00:37:28] >> You know, it it slipped. If you think
[00:37:29] about what was going on in 2020, 21,22.
[00:37:32] I mean, here's
[00:37:35] >> saying, you know what, I can do anything
[00:37:36] from home that I can do from the office.
[00:37:39] Okay, it's not the same level of
[00:37:41] excellence as where do I show up today?
[00:37:44] How do I bring people along? How do I be
[00:37:46] committed?
[00:37:47] >> It's just different
[00:37:49] >> at least in our business. I'm not going
[00:37:50] to say in our business. So, you know,
[00:37:53] really re-underwriting that level of
[00:37:54] excellence and also getting people to
[00:37:56] really rethink, you know, there is no
[00:37:58] perfection.
[00:38:00] >> Okay. But, you know, excellence is
[00:38:03] something that you can choose.
[00:38:04] >> Okay.
[00:38:05] >> And really re-underwriting that in the
[00:38:06] culture I think was something that came
[00:38:08] out of this. The other thing that came
[00:38:09] out of it as an exercise which wasn't
[00:38:12] really about defining the culture but I
[00:38:14] think helps a lot is it really allowed
[00:38:18] us as a leadership team and allowed me
[00:38:20] as the CEO to reunderwite the strategy
[00:38:24] and the way we wanted to communicate
[00:38:25] around the strategy and really get the
[00:38:27] whole leadership of the organization 450
[00:38:29] strong 100% on board with where we were
[00:38:32] going. And when you get a big
[00:38:33] organization, you get the top 450 people
[00:38:36] all aligned
[00:38:38] on strategically where you're going,
[00:38:39] boy, you get a lot of output.
[00:38:41] >> I think it's absolutely fascinating how
[00:38:44] long you folks have been around and and
[00:38:46] thrived. It's very rare. Uh my company's
[00:38:50] 19 years old, super proud of it. I'd
[00:38:53] like to be around in 150 not me, but I'd
[00:38:56] like the company to be around in 155
[00:38:58] years. What advice would you give me?
[00:39:01] What advice would you give founders like
[00:39:03] me?
[00:39:03] >> I I think it's the wrong I think it's
[00:39:05] the wrong lens. Okay.
[00:39:06] >> Okay. I I And look, it's interesting if
[00:39:10] you go back to companies that were
[00:39:11] founded, you know, in the middle of the
[00:39:12] 19th century, there aren't that many
[00:39:14] left. No.
[00:39:15] >> Okay. And
[00:39:16] >> by the way, companies founded now, you
[00:39:18] know, 100 years from now, there won't be
[00:39:19] that many left.
[00:39:21] >> I think that it's a random walk to
[00:39:24] create a hundred-y old company.
[00:39:26] >> And in the distribution, the world
[00:39:28] changes, the competitive landscape
[00:39:30] changes. Um, the goal should be to build
[00:39:33] the best business you can, the best
[00:39:34] company you can. And as long as you're
[00:39:37] doing that, you're really adding value
[00:39:39] to your clients, your customers, you
[00:39:41] know, you're adding value, opportunities
[00:39:43] will emerge that will allow you to go
[00:39:45] further, further, and further
[00:39:47] >> and you never know where it will wind
[00:39:48] up. But the world changes. I mean, go
[00:39:51] look, go take
[00:39:52] >> You guys change though. The world
[00:39:54] change, you change. Is there something
[00:39:56] about the culture
[00:39:57] >> like you pivot?
[00:39:59] >> We pivot. You pivoted huge scale.
[00:40:01] >> We've we've pivoted at huge scale. Um
[00:40:04] >> you know the history of Goldman Sachs is
[00:40:06] littered with moments where the firm
[00:40:07] came this close to going out of
[00:40:09] business.
[00:40:10] >> You can go back to 19 I mean I you can
[00:40:12] go back to 1929 of course
[00:40:14] >> there was there was but not just the
[00:40:16] crash during the crash there was
[00:40:17] actually something called the Goldman
[00:40:18] Sachs Trading Corporation which was a
[00:40:20] public entity that we know that
[00:40:22] basically plummeted and almost took the
[00:40:25] firm you know almost took the firm down.
[00:40:27] Um, pen, we were the commercial paper
[00:40:29] underwriter for Penn Central when Pen
[00:40:31] Central went bankrupt in the 1970s and
[00:40:34] that almost took the firm down. But just
[00:40:36] back to the question, you have pivoted
[00:40:38] at scale and I see startups pivoting but
[00:40:40] once they get to scale, they kind of
[00:40:42] stay heavy on the rails. They don't
[00:40:44] pivot when stuff comes. Tell me like for
[00:40:46] example, you pivoted pretty hard in AI.
[00:40:49] You've leaned in very hard on it. Um,
[00:40:52] you for a large company, you were pretty
[00:40:54] early on that train. I think we're good
[00:40:56] at figuring out how technology can make
[00:40:58] us better at what we do. But here's the
[00:40:59] here's here's the thing I think you have
[00:41:00] to be focused on. What do we do? We are,
[00:41:05] in my humble opinion, the best
[00:41:08] investment bank in the world.
[00:41:10] >> Yes,
[00:41:11] >> we
[00:41:14] run one of the two best trading
[00:41:16] businesses in the world. And the
[00:41:17] combination of kind of investment
[00:41:19] banking and trading, that's what Goldman
[00:41:21] Sachs is. We are the best in the world
[00:41:23] at it in my humble opinion. Yeah.
[00:41:25] >> Um certainly nobody would dispute that
[00:41:27] we're not one of the best in the world
[00:41:28] at that. And as long as we're really
[00:41:31] good at that and we continue to win at
[00:41:34] that and that's something that the world
[00:41:35] needs, you know, you can perpetuate if
[00:41:38] you make the right decisions and the
[00:41:39] right pivots. We also have become fifth,
[00:41:42] sixth, seventh, depending on how you
[00:41:44] look at it, largest active asset manager
[00:41:46] in the world. We supervised 3.3.4
[00:41:49] trillion dollars and that business is
[00:41:51] growing. We we said publicly we're going
[00:41:52] to grow at high single high single
[00:41:55] digits. We're growing it better than
[00:41:56] that. We've got an extraordinary wealth
[00:41:58] franchise and that business, you know,
[00:42:00] we have a right to win
[00:42:01] >> and we're a leader. And so, you know,
[00:42:03] ultimately to really sustain, you've got
[00:42:06] to really deliver value and you've got
[00:42:08] to have leading franchises. You have to
[00:42:10] have scale and you have a right to win.
[00:42:13] And the reason that that most business
[00:42:16] >> 20 years ago are gone.
[00:42:19] You're not. Yes, you have a right to
[00:42:22] win, but there was a bunch of pivots and
[00:42:23] a bunch of bets and through three
[00:42:26] different CEOs. What is it?
[00:42:29] >> You know, it's the culture's
[00:42:31] contributed, the quality of the people's
[00:42:32] contributed, the brand built over a long
[00:42:35] period of time.
[00:42:35] >> Is there a risking mentality inside the
[00:42:37] firm?
[00:42:38] >> We have a great we have a great risk
[00:42:39] takingaking. We have a great
[00:42:40] riskmanagement culture inside the firm.
[00:42:42] The reason that most that lots of
[00:42:43] financial institutions go away is not
[00:42:46] because they have a risk-taking culture
[00:42:47] or maybe it's because they don't have a
[00:42:49] risk management culture. So they make
[00:42:51] mistakes and you know financial firms
[00:42:53] are levered and they they get they get
[00:42:55] into uh they get into trouble.
[00:42:56] >> Yeah.
[00:42:57] >> You know decisions decisions around over
[00:42:59] decades things we would do wouldn't do.
[00:43:02] When the world goes left you know we
[00:43:04] think left is we go slower.
[00:43:06] >> Yeah.
[00:43:07] >> Um you don't have to be first
[00:43:10] >> in financial services. I think even
[00:43:12] second mover advantage is underrated.
[00:43:14] >> Yeah.
[00:43:15] >> Um succession planning.
[00:43:18] >> I'm sure there were some folks that
[00:43:19] didn't work out, but it seems like
[00:43:21] Goldman's very good at that. And I think
[00:43:22] a lot of tech companies are going to
[00:43:24] have to go through it. What did they
[00:43:26] were what are they doing right? Like you
[00:43:27] you're the last three seem like you seem
[00:43:29] like I'm a winner of a succession
[00:43:31] planning output. Um what are they doing?
[00:43:35] I think one of the things that's
[00:43:37] interesting about Goldman Sachs is there
[00:43:40] are ext the senior leadership at Goldman
[00:43:42] Sachs is an extraordinary group of
[00:43:43] people. I sit around, you know, the
[00:43:44] small table, whether it's the management
[00:43:46] committee, which is a slightly bigger
[00:43:48] table
[00:43:48] >> or even with, you know, the the closest
[00:43:50] group of of senior leaders at the firm
[00:43:52] and I'm in awe at how smart and talented
[00:43:54] and capable and committed and um
[00:43:57] extraordinary, you know, that group of
[00:43:59] people is. So, let's just start by the
[00:44:00] fact there were lots of people that
[00:44:01] could have run Goldman Sachs. goes back
[00:44:03] to the serendipity point.
[00:44:04] >> You know,
[00:44:06] >> Lloyd Blankfine got sick in 2015
[00:44:09] >> and he decided that he was going to deal
[00:44:11] with his treatment and continue to run
[00:44:13] the firm and then come back. There are
[00:44:15] people who would have gotten sick and
[00:44:16] said, "You know what? I'm sick. I'm
[00:44:18] going to step away." Okay. Had he
[00:44:21] stepped away, I wouldn't be CEO. At that
[00:44:23] point, the firm probably would make Gary
[00:44:25] Con the CEO. So, because Gary was the,
[00:44:27] you know, the president of the firm at
[00:44:28] that point in time. So, you know,
[00:44:29] serendipity and luck. If the succession
[00:44:31] had happened in 2013 or 2014 or 2015, it
[00:44:34] wouldn't have been me. But it happened,
[00:44:36] it happened in 2018.
[00:44:37] >> Did the board interview you and several
[00:44:39] other people and was there a rigorous
[00:44:41] process?
[00:44:41] >> The board the board knows the senior
[00:44:43] leadership really well. The board knows
[00:44:46] the senior leadership really well and
[00:44:47] ours is a firm where there are lots of
[00:44:49] people that can run the firm.
[00:44:51] >> Um, ultimately there's got to be a
[00:44:52] decision.
[00:44:53] >> Um, and look, I think succession is
[00:44:55] very,
[00:44:56] >> you know, very, very important. And one
[00:44:57] of the things I'm proud of is that we
[00:45:00] have a very stable senior leadership
[00:45:02] team at the firm right now. We've been
[00:45:03] working together and executing, you
[00:45:06] know, on this plan over the last seven
[00:45:07] years. And I think it's one of the
[00:45:08] reasons why we're making really good
[00:45:09] progress.
[00:45:10] >> Okay. Back to a point you made. You're
[00:45:12] you're apprenticeship culture. You hire
[00:45:14] tons of young folks who are smart. My
[00:45:17] son's in business school now and
[00:45:19] everyone in his class wants to work for
[00:45:21] you.
[00:45:23] What's going to happen 10 years from now
[00:45:26] with AI and that apprenticeship culture
[00:45:29] and bringing all these folks in? Do you
[00:45:31] think it changes? Like what's your
[00:45:33] where's your head at on that?
[00:45:34] >> I I think there's always change at the
[00:45:37] margin, but I think the substance of who
[00:45:40] we are and what we are and what we do
[00:45:42] and the fact that we need lots of very
[00:45:44] bright people interacting together.
[00:45:46] Yeah.
[00:45:46] >> Building trust.
[00:45:48] >> Um I don't think that changes. And
[00:45:50] here's here's the analogy I give you.
[00:45:51] And I've been talking about this for a
[00:45:53] number of years. And so um you know
[00:45:54] there's some people that will listen to
[00:45:56] this will say I've heard David you know
[00:45:57] say this before. When I started in 1984
[00:46:00] >> one of my first assignments was to go do
[00:46:03] a common stock comparison.
[00:46:05] >> Okay.
[00:46:05] >> Comparing five regional banks and how
[00:46:08] their stock had traded for five years.
[00:46:10] That was a big assignment. How'd you go
[00:46:12] do that? You went to the library. What
[00:46:14] was the only data source that existed in
[00:46:17] the world that had the closing stock
[00:46:19] price for every stock that traded for
[00:46:21] every single day? Back issues of the
[00:46:23] Wall Street Journal. So you went to the
[00:46:25] library, you went to the microfich and
[00:46:26] you took out on microfich back issues of
[00:46:28] the Wall Street Journal. You did all the
[00:46:30] work to go through all the old issues of
[00:46:32] the journal and find the specific stock
[00:46:34] prices. You took out green line graph
[00:46:37] paper and you plotted the graph. You
[00:46:40] then took it to a Xerox machine and
[00:46:42] copied it. And then you went to your
[00:46:44] client and you showed them this and they
[00:46:46] said, "Wow, thank you for helping us
[00:46:48] understand this." It took, I mean, I
[00:46:50] don't know, it took four to six hours to
[00:46:51] do the work to do it. Technology has
[00:46:54] constantly made super productive people
[00:46:58] more productive, more capable. I see
[00:47:01] this the same way. Now, of course,
[00:47:03] technology also replaces certain jobs
[00:47:07] 100%. We don't have a lot of toll
[00:47:08] collectors. No,
[00:47:09] >> you know, anymore.
[00:47:11] >> But that doesn't mean when you get into
[00:47:14] the things that we do, which is a lot
[00:47:16] about trust,
[00:47:18] personal relationships,
[00:47:21] um, advice, you know, at the center of a
[00:47:23] lot of what we we do. These become tools
[00:47:26] that enhance, speed up, and allow us to
[00:47:28] do it even in a broader context. We're
[00:47:30] still going to need a lot of people to
[00:47:31] do it. Okay? and they're just they will
[00:47:33] be trained with different skills with
[00:47:35] different skills in different you know
[00:47:37] in in different ways and of course
[00:47:39] >> you know I I you know let's let's take
[00:47:41] one that I just I just think is is
[00:47:43] obvious
[00:47:44] >> okay all companies have massive
[00:47:47] financial reporting and accounting
[00:47:49] functions
[00:47:50] >> the operational
[00:47:53] processes for that are going to be
[00:47:54] different and they're going to have a
[00:47:56] different number of people associated
[00:47:57] with them but that doesn't mean that
[00:48:00] you're not going to have people in other
[00:48:02] ways. I mean, you know, for me, I'm
[00:48:04] excited about what this technology does
[00:48:06] because we're looking at how we can
[00:48:08] reimagine processes that actually free
[00:48:10] up the capacity for us to invest in more
[00:48:14] people for our businesses that actually
[00:48:17] scale with people
[00:48:18] >> because we're somewhat limited. We've
[00:48:19] got to deliver returns every year. We
[00:48:21] can't scale as quickly as we want or as
[00:48:23] fast as we want. So, I think it's an
[00:48:25] unbelievable opportunity. It's
[00:48:27] accelerating certain things that are
[00:48:28] very cool, but I also don't think it's
[00:48:30] fundamentally changing the core of what
[00:48:32] we do and how we do it. It just makes
[00:48:34] it, you know, more it's a very powerful
[00:48:36] tool for very productive people.
[00:48:38] >> Okay, I'm going to ask you one more
[00:48:40] question that your team told me not to
[00:48:42] ask, so we can cut it out.
[00:48:44] >> You can ask me anything.
[00:48:46] >> Uh, I thought it was super cool that you
[00:48:49] were a CEO DJ. like it it elevated your
[00:48:52] brand in this one consumer's mind and
[00:48:55] Goldman's brand. It seemed like
[00:48:59] I just thought it was [ __ ] cool. It
[00:49:01] seemed like you got talked out of that.
[00:49:03] Um
[00:49:04] >> well, a couple of things. First of all,
[00:49:06] I mean I I I I have to go back and tell
[00:49:08] my team it's not me telling my team I
[00:49:10] don't want to talk about this. It's for
[00:49:11] some reason, you know, people on my team
[00:49:13] thinking that we shouldn't talk about
[00:49:14] this. And um
[00:49:16] >> that's not Do you stop doing it?
[00:49:18] >> I stopped doing it publicly. Yeah,
[00:49:20] >> I still do it.
[00:49:21] >> It seemed like people were complaining
[00:49:22] that you were doing doing what happened,
[00:49:25] you know, what happened at at the
[00:49:26] beginning of the first few years.
[00:49:28] >> Yeah.
[00:49:28] >> Um, you know, I wasn't, you know, I was
[00:49:30] doing it eight to 10 times a year
[00:49:31] publicly. It's not I was giving money to
[00:49:33] charity every time I did it. It's not
[00:49:35] it's not as though I was doing it every
[00:49:37] weekend or something, but
[00:49:39] >> it's a hobby. It's a passion. I really
[00:49:42] enjoy it. It's creative.
[00:49:43] >> Yeah.
[00:49:44] >> And when everything was going right, it
[00:49:46] was great. in 2022 when the firm started
[00:49:48] having some speed bumps because the
[00:49:50] environment changed and we were
[00:49:51] wrestling with some of this stuff around
[00:49:52] consumer.
[00:49:53] >> So, you caught some flack.
[00:49:54] >> I caught some flack and and by the way,
[00:49:55] I thought I was going to catch some flak
[00:49:57] if things weren't perfect, but boy, I
[00:50:00] caught a lot more flack than than I
[00:50:02] thought I would. And by the way, I
[00:50:03] caught a lot of flack on a lot of stuff,
[00:50:05] not just the fact that I DJed
[00:50:06] occasionally.
[00:50:08] >> Um,
[00:50:09] and so I kind of reached the conclusion
[00:50:11] this is becoming a distraction. M
[00:50:14] >> and look, I I think it's unfortunate
[00:50:16] because nobody cares that I do lots of
[00:50:18] other things with my free time. They
[00:50:19] really shouldn't care about this.
[00:50:21] >> I still do it privately and I'll do it
[00:50:23] publicly again because I really enjoy it
[00:50:24] and and it's a great it's a great
[00:50:27] creative outlet and I feel lucky that
[00:50:28] I've had the opportunity to do it.
[00:50:30] >> I I think you're cool.
[00:50:32] >> Hardly.
[00:50:33] >> I think you're a great steward for the
[00:50:34] company. They're lucky to have you. I
[00:50:36] want to congratulate you on all your
[00:50:37] success and thanks for coming on the
[00:50:39] podcast.
[00:50:39] >> Well, thank you for having me. I really
[00:50:40] enjoyed it. Good to be with you.
[00:50:42] >> Pleasure. Thanks a lot.
[00:50:43] >> Okay. Hope you like that. He's very
[00:50:46] sharp. Um just my take on his vibe is
[00:50:51] very polished, very articulate, very
[00:50:54] CEOish, and it's a similar vibe to other
[00:50:58] professional CEOs I've interviewed like
[00:51:01] Nikesh at Powalto. Um is also like this.
[00:51:05] Um and I don't know you well, but I bet
[00:51:07] you could use a little polish yourself.
[00:51:09] So maybe watching him, you'll learn a
[00:51:11] few tips. Well, I ask everybody on these
[00:51:13] pods like what's important when you're
[00:51:14] hiring people. And he he likes to say
[00:51:17] you want them smart enough. They don't
[00:51:19] have to be rocket science, but kind of
[00:51:21] smart enough. But he really values
[00:51:23] judgment and experience. Most startups
[00:51:26] don't. Um I look at HubSpot like half
[00:51:28] our exec team is kind of homegrown and
[00:51:32] half is hire from the outside. I don't
[00:51:34] know if that's the right ratio, but his
[00:51:36] is a lot of kind of been there, done
[00:51:37] that people. I think that's pretty
[00:51:39] interesting the way he thinks about it.
[00:51:40] We talk a lot about decisions. We talk
[00:51:42] about the Apple decisions. And to me,
[00:51:44] it's just like you're always choosing as
[00:51:46] a CEO between two shitty decisions. No
[00:51:48] easy decisions ever reach your desk. And
[00:51:51] to me, that's just life in the big city.
[00:51:53] You've got a lot of that and get used to
[00:51:55] it. Okay. I like the segment on his
[00:51:58] Apple decision. Uh they made a bet on
[00:52:01] the consumer business and a big
[00:52:02] partnership in Apple. And there's it
[00:52:06] reminded me of a book a guy named Seth
[00:52:08] Goden wrote a long time ago and on the
[00:52:09] cover of the book was something called
[00:52:11] the dip. It's a line and there's a dip
[00:52:14] and then it comes across. And when
[00:52:16] you're heading down the dip on a new
[00:52:17] project like they were, you don't know
[00:52:19] if you're about to hit the bottom and
[00:52:20] come up the other side. You don't know
[00:52:22] if it just keeps going down. In his
[00:52:24] case, he was like, I think it's going to
[00:52:25] keep going down. We're going to kill it.
[00:52:27] That's very hard to do. We have lots of
[00:52:30] these inside of HubSpot over the years
[00:52:32] where project's going okay. We funded it
[00:52:35] pretty well and the people inside that
[00:52:37] project are like just give us six more
[00:52:40] months and give us some more money and
[00:52:41] we're going to get through the dip and
[00:52:42] it's going to rip. Um versus just
[00:52:46] killing it. And we tend to to give it a
[00:52:50] lifeline. And I think more often than
[00:52:51] not, we should say no to those things.
[00:52:54] Anyway, those are kind of my thoughts on
[00:52:56] decision-m.
[00:52:57] say no more often and kill stuff more
[00:53:00] often. Uh I think people aren't
[00:53:02] disciplined enough about that. Those big
[00:53:05] partnerships are hard. Um and people
[00:53:09] always want to partner with the giant in
[00:53:11] their industry and the life expectancy
[00:53:14] of those partnerships are pretty low. Um
[00:53:18] a few tips on kind of dancing with
[00:53:21] elephants. Uh the first is if you're
[00:53:24] going to do a partnership, you need to
[00:53:25] make sure your incentives are really
[00:53:27] well aligned.
[00:53:29] And you need to make sure like if we do
[00:53:31] this, your P&L is moving and their P&L
[00:53:34] is moving in the correct direction
[00:53:35] because if the spreadsheets aren't
[00:53:37] moving, there's no point really in doing
[00:53:39] it. And the third is you kind of need to
[00:53:42] know the CEO. The CEOs need to be
[00:53:44] committed because as you go through
[00:53:46] annual budgeting cycles, partnerships
[00:53:48] can get defunded. So if the CEOs are
[00:53:50] connected, that helps a lot. Those are
[00:53:53] if you're entering into a big giant
[00:53:55] partnership, try to get those things
[00:53:57] right. Okay. Asked him, you want your
[00:54:00] company around for 150 years. What's
[00:54:01] your advice? First of all, he credited
[00:54:03] luck quite a bit, but he largely
[00:54:05] credited culture. And I'll tell you my
[00:54:07] journey with culture at HubSpot. When we
[00:54:10] first started the company called the
[00:54:12] first three years, my co-founder and I
[00:54:15] were like, "Culture is BS. Don't even
[00:54:18] bring it up. can't like let's not talk
[00:54:20] about it. And then I joined a CEO group
[00:54:24] and one of the CEOs in the CEO group was
[00:54:26] Colin Engel. He made the he was iO
[00:54:30] vacuum cleaners and I remember I sat
[00:54:31] down next to him at that at first it was
[00:54:34] a CEO group meeting and it was my first
[00:54:37] one. I didn't know how it worked but
[00:54:39] they have a topic for the whole day and
[00:54:42] the topic on my first meeting was
[00:54:44] culture ship. And so we went through the
[00:54:47] whole morning and I was talking with
[00:54:49] Colin at lunch and Colin says, you know,
[00:54:51] you don't seem to like this topic much.
[00:54:53] I'm like, nah, I think it's a waste of
[00:54:54] time. And he says to me, you know,
[00:54:57] Brian,
[00:54:58] culture is how people make decisions
[00:55:00] when you're not in a room. Culture is
[00:55:02] how you really scale. Yeah, good. I'm
[00:55:06] dug in. Colin says it's true. I'm I'm
[00:55:08] in. And I go back to the office the next
[00:55:10] day and my co-founder
[00:55:12] um says, "Well, how was the meeting?
[00:55:14] How's Colin?"
[00:55:15] And I said, "It was great. I loved it."
[00:55:18] What'd you talk about? We talked about
[00:55:20] culture. Oh, that's too bad. Waste of
[00:55:23] time. He said, "No, Darmsh.
[00:55:26] Culture is how people make decisions
[00:55:28] when you're not in the room. Culture is
[00:55:30] how you really scale your company." And
[00:55:32] in a very weak moment, he agreed to be
[00:55:34] our culture sar. And we did two things
[00:55:36] on culture that really worked. One was
[00:55:39] we started measuring net promoter scores
[00:55:41] of our employees. And we've been doing
[00:55:42] that for 19 years. Really useful metric.
[00:55:44] And the other is we we basically
[00:55:47] designed the culture. We designed the
[00:55:49] relationship between the company and and
[00:55:51] the employee and we built a deck called
[00:55:54] our culture code. And the way we thought
[00:55:56] about it was we have a product that we
[00:55:58] sell to our customers. It has to be
[00:56:00] unique and really valuable and it pulls
[00:56:02] customers in. Our second product we sell
[00:56:04] to our employees has to be unique and
[00:56:07] really valuable to pull those employees
[00:56:09] in. So we spend a lot of time on it and
[00:56:11] it's part of HubSpot's secret sauce is
[00:56:13] our culture code and the way we kind of
[00:56:15] think about that. So I would I would
[00:56:17] encourage you folks to do that. If you
[00:56:18] want to be around for 150 years, think a
[00:56:21] lot about culture. I like the way he
[00:56:23] talked about serendipity in there and I
[00:56:25] think that matters. There's a book by
[00:56:30] Jim Collins on why amazingly successful
[00:56:33] companies fail. And if you look at like
[00:56:36] the the top 100 most successful
[00:56:38] companies in the world, you know, even
[00:56:40] 25 years ago to today, man, it's just
[00:56:43] totally changed. So like there's a lot
[00:56:45] of disruption that happens. And Jim
[00:56:47] Collins studied these companies that
[00:56:49] stumble. And he's got this whole kind of
[00:56:52] ladder of things that go wrong, but the
[00:56:54] first step on the ladder is hubris born
[00:56:56] of success. And he talks about these
[00:56:58] companies falling into the trap. He's
[00:57:00] got a great quote and it goes, "Those
[00:57:03] who fail to acknowledge the role luck
[00:57:05] may have played in their success and
[00:57:08] thereby overestimate their own merit and
[00:57:10] capabilities will have succumbed to
[00:57:12] hubris." I wish all of you to avoid that
[00:57:16] hubris trap and I'll see you all on the
[00:57:19] next episode of Long Strange Trek.
