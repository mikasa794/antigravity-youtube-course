[00:00:08] How can capitalism
help solve climate change?
[00:00:14] I'm Steve Howard,
I'm vice chair of sustainability
[00:00:16] at global investment firm Temasek.
[00:00:18] I've been wrestling with this question
for about three decades.
[00:00:23] Formerly I was chief
sustainability officer at IKEA.
[00:00:26] I've helped set up several
climate change organizations.
[00:00:29] We Mean Business Coalition,
the Climate Group,
[00:00:31] and recently Tilt Collective.
[00:00:33] And I've come to conclusions
that there are some real hard truths.
[00:00:38] The first hard truth:
[00:00:40] every business is a machine.
[00:00:43] They are hardwired and softwired
to do what they do.
[00:00:47] That's why they're really good at it.
[00:00:49] Let me give you an example.
[00:00:51] About 15 years ago,
[00:00:53] I sat in the headquarters
of a global car manufacturer
[00:00:56] with their chief technology officer.
[00:00:59] I said to him, "Surely
the future is electric vehicles."
[00:01:03] He slapped the table and said,
[00:01:05] "Never, while I am CTO,
will we make an electric vehicle."
[00:01:11] Now he’s absolutely right,
because he’s no longer CTO.
[00:01:14] (Laughter)
[00:01:16] (Applause)
[00:01:20] Amazingly enough,
I got a taxi the other day
[00:01:23] in one of that company's
electric vehicles.
[00:01:25] (Cheers)
[00:01:26] But it's very easy to make that
about him and his leadership.
[00:01:29] But I realized that day
that in the buildings around us,
[00:01:33] there were hundreds
of proud, skilled engineers
[00:01:36] who'd spent their careers
[00:01:37] making ever-better
internal combustion engines.
[00:01:40] The company had spent 100 years
perfecting global supply chains
[00:01:44] for spark plugs and carburetors.
[00:01:47] This was an internal
combustion engine vehicle company,
[00:01:51] and change for companies like these
is incredibly hard.
[00:01:55] And many companies, from manufacturing
to technology and even finance,
[00:01:59] are hardwired and softwired
to do what they do.
[00:02:02] Now of course, there are exceptions,
but they’re exactly that:
[00:02:06] they’re exceptions.
[00:02:08] And we’re sorely mistaken if we think
[00:02:10] all companies will change
themselves by themselves.
[00:02:15] My second truth is that financial markets
[00:02:19] are incredibly short term.
[00:02:22] The leader of a private bank
said to me recently,
[00:02:25] "Steve, I've never met
a long-term investor."
[00:02:29] A hedge fund leader said to me,
[00:02:32] "Steve, you have to remember
we're profit-seeking creatures.
[00:02:36] I wake up in the morning and think,
how much profit will I make today?
[00:02:40] I go to bed at night and think,
how much profit did I make?"
[00:02:45] So markets are baked in
to pursue short-term profit
[00:02:50] over long-term value creation.
[00:02:52] The other thing is
the free market has had a free ride.
[00:02:57] If you asked an economist in the room,
they would talk about externalities.
[00:03:02] It's external to the market,
[00:03:03] but it's not external
to people and the planet.
[00:03:06] These are the costs that are borne
of the impacts on nature,
[00:03:11] of pollution,
[00:03:13] the destruction of our habitats,
[00:03:15] the impact on human health,
[00:03:17] and of course, the dramatically escalating
costs of climate change.
[00:03:22] They're not priced into the market.
[00:03:24] The companies don't pay the bill.
[00:03:26] Now economists can debate
the exact number,
[00:03:29] but we know they're
in the trillions of dollars,
[00:03:31] the bills mostly unpaid,
and it's rising by the day.
[00:03:36] So how do we go
from short term to long term?
[00:03:39] It's a difficult thing to do,
[00:03:41] but if you're a long-term investor,
a large asset owner, a pension fund,
[00:03:44] a sovereign wealth fund,
an endowment, a family office,
[00:03:48] then you're exposed to the total economy.
[00:03:51] The best guarantee
of your long-term financial success
[00:03:54] is economic growth itself.
[00:03:57] And we know an inclusive,
resilient economy
[00:04:01] where we tackle climate change
[00:04:03] is the one with the best economic growth.
[00:04:05] Again, the numbers have been run
time and time again
[00:04:08] on the impacts of unabated climate change.
[00:04:10] Cambridge University did one recently.
[00:04:13] Their estimate was unabated climate change
will wipe out a quarter of global GDP.
[00:04:18] That's five Covid pandemics,
and it's a pandemic that doesn't go away.
[00:04:24] So if you're a long-term investor,
[00:04:27] if you're an asset allocator,
a principal owner of capital,
[00:04:31] it's in your interests
to invest in solving climate change,
[00:04:35] not just in the easy things to do,
[00:04:37] but in the hard things to do
with conviction capital.
[00:04:41] Now, at Temasek,
we are a longer-term investor.
[00:04:44] We've just had our 50th anniversary.
[00:04:47] Our purpose is so that
every generation prospers.
[00:04:51] We have stakes
in some of the companies today
[00:04:54] that were the companies that we had
when we started 50 years ago.
[00:04:58] But in order to align ourselves
with climate change,
[00:05:02] we had to rewire ourselves.
[00:05:05] We had to measure
carbon portfolio emissions,
[00:05:08] set carbon budgets,
put an internal carbon price in,
[00:05:11] align our staff incentives with success,
[00:05:15] set those targets,
engage all our portfolio companies.
[00:05:19] And then we had to realign our strategies,
reskill our investment teams,
[00:05:23] invest in new partnerships
and new platform companies
[00:05:27] so that we had the capabilities
to invest in the sustainable businesses
[00:05:31] of today and tomorrow.
[00:05:34] Now our portfolio
[00:05:36] of sustainability-aligned investments
[00:05:37] is 40 billion SGD,
[00:05:40] up a lot from a few billion
just a few years ago.
[00:05:43] It’s growing, and it’s a start.
[00:05:45] This is a journey we're on,
but we're well on the way.
[00:05:49] The third truth:
[00:05:51] policy is a master switch.
[00:05:54] If we want to level the playing field
for climate technologies,
[00:05:57] we need long, loud, legal policies.
[00:06:02] This can unlock the investment
and get innovators innovating.
[00:06:07] Long, if you have a technology
that takes ten years to develop,
[00:06:11] there's no use having a policy
that's just one-year long.
[00:06:15] You need it to last
a full investment cycle.
[00:06:18] The policy must be loud.
[00:06:19] The signal must be unmissable.
[00:06:22] Legal means it must have teeth.
[00:06:24] Compliance can't be optional.
[00:06:27] Now, most businesses
don't embrace policies,
[00:06:31] but they want clarity,
they want a level playing field.
[00:06:34] And we know if we want
a free market to be a fair market,
[00:06:37] policy is a master switch.
[00:06:40] And in this environment we can say,
[00:06:42] actually we need all the countries,
we need large countries
[00:06:45] to have policy and not to roll them back.
[00:06:47] But actually whether you're a city,
a state, a smaller country,
[00:06:50] policy can be hugely powerful.
[00:06:53] Let's take the Singapore CO2 tax,
the carbon tax in Singapore.
[00:06:57] That's provided a price signal.
[00:06:59] It's priced an externality
by putting a price on carbon.
[00:07:03] It's allowed the businesses in Singapore,
including many of our portfolio companies,
[00:07:08] to turn long-term targets
into concrete actions and plans
[00:07:12] to decarbonize their business.
[00:07:14] They can create the business case
because of that carbon price.
[00:07:18] It's also had a link
to global carbon markets,
[00:07:21] and global carbon markets
are going to be increasingly important
[00:07:24] over the next decade,
[00:07:25] because you can meet
some of your obligation for the tax
[00:07:29] with international carbon credits.
[00:07:31] So it's allowed our own
platform company, GenZero,
[00:07:35] to invest with greater confidence
[00:07:37] in projects that are removing
and reducing emissions elsewhere.
[00:07:40] Nature-based solutions,
forest restoration projects.
[00:07:44] Policy can be a carrot as well as a stick.
[00:07:48] In Singapore, they went
for super fast regulatory approval
[00:07:52] for plant-based proteins
and cell-cultivated meats.
[00:07:56] If you're a startup, you measure time
in days and weeks, not years.
[00:08:01] So being able to get to market quickly
and meet your customers,
[00:08:05] test your products,
and get revenue in is invaluable.
[00:08:09] Singapore has become a hub
for these companies now.
[00:08:13] But it's not just for startups
that fast regulatory approval
[00:08:16] and good planning is a big boon.
[00:08:19] It's for big infrastructure
projects as well.
[00:08:21] Why be tied up for years
if you can have effective, fast planning.
[00:08:26] Then it gets green shovels in the ground
and green investment flowing.
[00:08:31] My fourth truth is just a word.
[00:08:34] It’s only one word,
and it’s a really important one.
[00:08:37] Better.
[00:08:38] I learned this when I was in IKEA.
[00:08:40] And I'm going to give you an example.
[00:08:42] When I started in IKEA,
we had some LED lights.
[00:08:46] They were expensive,
[00:08:48] sales were limited, and the light
was still harsh and stark.
[00:08:53] But we knew because
it was so much more energy-efficient
[00:08:56] and the technology was developing,
[00:08:58] we knew they were the future.
[00:09:00] So we set a target for ourselves
[00:09:01] to go for 100 percent LEDs
across the business.
[00:09:04] We aligned all our investments
with ever-better LEDs.
[00:09:08] We communicated across the supply chains,
[00:09:10] we used our own purchasing power
[00:09:12] to secure finance for new factories
and production lines.
[00:09:17] When we got to the LED
that was not just energy efficient
[00:09:21] but was affordable
with a great quality of light,
[00:09:25] the next best thing to daylight,
[00:09:27] they flew off the shelves.
[00:09:29] And we hit our target
of being able to only sell LEDs from 2015.
[00:09:35] When you get to better,
you get scale really fast.
[00:09:40] So if you look at the total
global lighting sector,
[00:09:43] in 2010, it was less than
one percent LEDs,
[00:09:46] more than 99 percent all the other
types of light bulbs.
[00:09:50] By 2020, it was more than 60 percent.
[00:09:54] We flipped the entire
global lighting sector
[00:09:57] that had been around
for more than 100 years in a decade.
[00:10:00] When you get to better,
you get to scale really fast.
[00:10:02] And we know that there are
many other technologies
[00:10:05] that have got to better.
[00:10:07] They've moved from the green premium
to the green discount.
[00:10:10] Solar. Wind. Batteries. Storage.
[00:10:14] It's very exciting.
[00:10:15] And when you get to better,
[00:10:17] these technologies create platforms
for business model innovation.
[00:10:21] Our impact investing partner, Leapfrog,
has invested in a startup in India.
[00:10:26] It's a young startup,
they're doing battery swapping stations
[00:10:29] for two-wheeler drivers
and auto rickshaw drivers.
[00:10:32] So rather than have
a long queue to refuel,
[00:10:36] you can drive in,
[00:10:37] in two minutes
your battery is swapped out,
[00:10:39] it's a fixed price,
[00:10:40] you can have a cup of chai,
you drive away.
[00:10:43] It's cleaner, it's cheaper, it's quieter,
it's mechanically more efficient.
[00:10:48] The customers love it.
[00:10:49] They've got 75,000 drivers
on their platform and growing.
[00:10:53] They’re doing more
than three million swaps a month.
[00:10:57] Now we know that there are
many other areas
[00:10:59] where in emerging markets,
[00:11:02] this business model innovation
with these better technologies --
[00:11:05] pay-as-you-go solar
is a great example there --
[00:11:08] but capital is scarce.
[00:11:10] We need capital allocators
to allocate capital for emerging markets.
[00:11:15] The other area where
it's really hard to find finance
[00:11:18] is for those technologies
[00:11:20] that haven't achieved
full commercial parity yet.
[00:11:23] The big industrial plants
[00:11:25] that are going for their first,
second or third of a kind plants,
[00:11:28] sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen,
[00:11:30] green cement, green steel,
[00:11:33] those cell-cultivated meats
and plant-based proteins.
[00:11:37] Now these industries, let's be clear,
are the industries of the future.
[00:11:42] If you're an investor or a policymaker,
[00:11:44] you have to know they're the future
and lean in behind them.
[00:11:47] And it will be cleaner,
cheaper, better, faster, tastier future.
[00:11:53] Let's take one example.
[00:11:55] We have invested
at Temasek for a long time
[00:11:57] in large real estate businesses.
[00:11:58] They are big users of steel,
cement and concrete.
[00:12:03] If you take cement
in the form of concrete,
[00:12:06] it's the second most abundant material
we use after water,
[00:12:09] 30 billion tons a year,
[00:12:12] eight percent of CO2.
[00:12:14] It’s hyper-commoditized,
[00:12:16] very slim margins, lots of sunk capital
in cement factories around the world.
[00:12:23] It's hard to innovate, hard to transform.
[00:12:25] We've invested in a company
that's got an end-of-pipe solution.
[00:12:28] Basically, it's a bolt-on technology
that captures the CO2
[00:12:32] that would otherwise cause climate change
and pollute the atmosphere,
[00:12:36] it remineralizes it
and incorporates it back in the cement
[00:12:40] so you get zero pollution and more cement.
[00:12:43] But you need patient capital
behind these sort of companies.
[00:12:47] That company alone has taken 100,000 hours
of R&D on the technology,
[00:12:51] and it's going to need a lot of capital
[00:12:53] to roll that out
across the cement industry.
[00:12:57] I have an ask.
[00:13:00] Yeah.
[00:13:01] If you’re a policymaker,
[00:13:04] let's go for long, loud,
legal policy regimes.
[00:13:08] Let's make the free market a fair market.
[00:13:11] Let's price externalities.
[00:13:14] But this is going to unlock
[00:13:17] a green industrial revolution
in your economy.
[00:13:19] It's going to create
the green jobs of the future.
[00:13:22] It's going to future-proof your economies.
[00:13:26] If you're an asset allocator
or you influence one,
[00:13:29] if you're in a pension fund,
[00:13:31] if you're in an endowment,
a family office,
[00:13:33] a sovereign wealth fund elsewhere
where you're allocating capital,
[00:13:37] take a pot of patient long-term capital
[00:13:40] and put it behind climate change --
[00:13:43] not just for the easy things to do,
but for the hard things to do.
[00:13:47] It's in your interest to do it,
[00:13:50] and you'll be backing
the industries of the future.
[00:13:53] I know many of the people in that sector,
and I am talking to you.
[00:13:57] Remember the ask.
[00:13:59] If you're an individual,
[00:14:02] then actually maybe you
have a pension or some savings.
[00:14:06] Look at your provider.
[00:14:08] Ask them what their climate allocation is.
[00:14:10] If they don't have a great answer,
move it somewhere else.
[00:14:14] If you're a business leader
or an entrepreneur,
[00:14:17] embrace change,
[00:14:18] unlock opportunity and go for better.
[00:14:23] Now this won't be easy,
[00:14:25] but we've used this playbook before.
[00:14:28] Good government policy and incentives.
[00:14:30] Business innovation and investment.
[00:14:32] We've ended acid rain,
we've closed the ozone hole,
[00:14:36] we've harnessed the power
of the sun and the wind
[00:14:38] to create the cheapest form
of energy on the planet.
[00:14:41] And we have five billion years
of sun reserves.
[00:14:46] We've also lit a billion homes with LEDs.
[00:14:51] And we have to remember,
humanity wrote the rulebook.
[00:14:56] We've created all the markets.
[00:14:58] We've allowed externalities.
[00:15:01] We write all the policies.
[00:15:03] We've built all the machines.
[00:15:06] But if we rewire capitalism,
we can help solve climate change.
[00:15:10] Thank you.
[00:15:12] (Applause)
