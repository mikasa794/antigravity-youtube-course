[00:00:05] Gabe, thanks for doing this.
[00:00:07] >> Of course.
[00:00:08] >> Yeah, thanks for coming.
[00:00:09] >> Maybe we can just start with like for
[00:00:11] anyone who hasn't heard of Harvey, what
[00:00:13] is the company? Can you talk about the
[00:00:14] scale and who you serve today?
[00:00:16] >> At Harvey, we're building AI for law
[00:00:18] firms and large in-house teams. We're
[00:00:21] almost at 1,000 customers, 500
[00:00:23] employees. started about just over three
[00:00:27] and a half years ago and so been kind of
[00:00:29] scaling quickly since then and kind of
[00:00:31] you guys were some of our OG seed
[00:00:33] investors. So yeah, good to be here.
[00:00:36] >> Maybe from a most basic perspective on
[00:00:38] the product, why is it not just you know
[00:00:41] co-pilot or touchp or claude?
[00:00:43] >> Yeah, I think that's how the product
[00:00:45] started. So when we first raised from
[00:00:48] OpenAI, we got access to GPD4. And I
[00:00:52] think GPD3 to GBD4 was such a big model
[00:00:55] jump that the intuition at the time was
[00:00:57] just give the model to lawyers and have
[00:00:59] them play with it. And I think that
[00:01:02] industry was so textheavy that you got
[00:01:06] so much value from just interacting with
[00:01:08] the models. And then I think as soon as
[00:01:11] you gave it to lawyers, you also ran
[00:01:13] into all of the sharp edges of the
[00:01:15] models of they hallucinate. They're not
[00:01:17] connected to a bunch of our context. And
[00:01:20] so I would say the past the kind of
[00:01:22] first two years of the company were how
[00:01:24] do we build essentially the IDE for
[00:01:26] lawyers around these models that connect
[00:01:28] it to all of the context you need to be
[00:01:30] productive as an individual lawyer. But
[00:01:33] I would say in the past year and going
[00:01:35] forward, the big problem we're solving
[00:01:36] is not how do you make individual
[00:01:38] lawyers more productive. It's how do you
[00:01:41] make a team of lawyers working on a
[00:01:42] client matter more productive? And more
[00:01:44] importantly, how do you make an entire
[00:01:46] law firm working on thousands of these
[00:01:48] client matters more productive and more
[00:01:50] profitable? And so I think when you get
[00:01:52] to that scale, a lot of the problems
[00:01:54] we're solving are not just model
[00:01:55] intelligence problems. they are these
[00:01:58] orchestration governance and kind of all
[00:02:00] of the enterprise product problems that
[00:02:01] you run into at at scale.
[00:02:04] >> You've also been broadening from just
[00:02:05] law firms into enterprises into big
[00:02:07] companies using you in concert with both
[00:02:09] our in-house legal teams and external uh
[00:02:11] council. Can you talk more about that
[00:02:12] and how that's been evolving as well?
[00:02:14] Yeah. So, we started selling to the
[00:02:17] largest law firms and something that
[00:02:20] started happening about a year and a
[00:02:21] half ago was these law firms started
[00:02:24] showing Harvey to their clients and
[00:02:26] their clients both wanted to collaborate
[00:02:29] more effectively with their law firms
[00:02:30] and they also wanted to use this
[00:02:32] directly in their in-house department.
[00:02:34] So, we recently announced we signed
[00:02:37] Walmart. We're working with AT&T, a
[00:02:38] bunch of these Fortune 500 large private
[00:02:41] equity firms, Global 2000, kind of the
[00:02:43] largest consumers of legal services. And
[00:02:47] what we're starting to build is a
[00:02:50] platform for the in-house teams to do
[00:02:52] the work that they do internally. So
[00:02:54] things like contracting and this long
[00:02:56] tale of all of the legal operations you
[00:02:59] need to do that you typically don't send
[00:03:01] out to law firms but also the
[00:03:03] collaborative tissue of I'm working on a
[00:03:06] large transaction a litigation I need
[00:03:08] outside expertise I want to securely
[00:03:10] share this data with my law firm and
[00:03:12] there's a lot of technical problems
[00:03:15] there around security data privacy that
[00:03:17] we want to solve so these law firms and
[00:03:19] their clients can collaborate
[00:03:20] effectively
[00:03:21] >> I think for uh you know we have um a
[00:03:24] largely technical audience, but also
[00:03:26] most people don't know exactly what
[00:03:28] legal workflow looks like.
[00:03:30] >> Yeah.
[00:03:30] >> Um I think before we really started
[00:03:32] working together, I imagined it as just
[00:03:33] like, well, what do you mean? I like
[00:03:35] email my lawyer and he thinks about it
[00:03:36] and like reads a document and then sends
[00:03:39] something back, right? And um there's
[00:03:41] like redlinining involved somewhere and
[00:03:42] maybe there's negotiation.
[00:03:43] >> Yeah.
[00:03:44] >> Can you paint a picture of just what
[00:03:46] workflow means to to you guys?
[00:03:48] >> Yeah. Yeah. And I I think a lot of
[00:03:50] people when they think about legal, they
[00:03:51] think of consumer legal and so I have a
[00:03:54] lease and I need to get, you know, input
[00:03:56] on that. That's completely different
[00:03:58] than what these massive law firms are
[00:04:00] doing. And so I think a really good
[00:04:02] example of what these firms are doing
[00:04:05] that I mean you guys will be familiar
[00:04:06] with and I think a lot of people in the
[00:04:09] startup space will be familiar with is
[00:04:11] what law firms do for venture capital
[00:04:13] firms or private equity firms. Mhm.
[00:04:15] >> And so VCs, PE firms, they do two main
[00:04:19] things. You raise money and you invest
[00:04:20] it.
[00:04:21] >> And so the main podcast
[00:04:24] >> and podcast, which is actually
[00:04:25] important, but there's less legal work
[00:04:26] there.
[00:04:27] >> Um, and the important things you need to
[00:04:29] do there are fund formation. So how do I
[00:04:31] structure the entity that is going to
[00:04:33] hold all that money?
[00:04:35] >> And it sounds easy, but if you're a
[00:04:36] large private equity firm, you have a
[00:04:38] sovereign wealth fund that comes in and
[00:04:40] they say, "We need to structure it in
[00:04:41] this way because of tax implications."
[00:04:44] Then you have a pension fund that has
[00:04:45] these other requirements. And so it ends
[00:04:47] up being this incredibly complex process
[00:04:49] of how do you draft the limited
[00:04:51] partnership agreement which can be 100
[00:04:53] pages. Every investor that's investing
[00:04:55] you can have a hundred and they all have
[00:04:57] side letters that modify that and you
[00:04:59] need to understand if I modify it this
[00:05:01] way it's going to have these
[00:05:02] implications. And a lot of it is the
[00:05:04] project management that also goes around
[00:05:06] coordinating all of these products if
[00:05:07] you're raising you know a billion dollar
[00:05:09] fund. And then once you've created that
[00:05:11] fund, there's all the investments you do
[00:05:12] out of that fund. And so for example,
[00:05:15] when we did, you know, any of our
[00:05:16] series, you need to get a data room. We
[00:05:19] share a bunch of data. You look at that.
[00:05:21] You need to understand the contracts we
[00:05:23] have to make sure that the revenue we
[00:05:25] say we have is actually structured in
[00:05:27] the way we've claimed. And you know, are
[00:05:29] there litigation? All these things. And
[00:05:31] so it's this massively complex process
[00:05:34] of understanding. And I I think one
[00:05:37] analogy you can think of like
[00:05:39] understanding a code base, but the
[00:05:40] codebase is all of these contracts and
[00:05:42] all this legal work. And I think the
[00:05:44] reason legal is so difficult is the
[00:05:48] workflows aren't structured. So the same
[00:05:50] way with programming, it's really hard
[00:05:52] until these models to build tools for
[00:05:54] programmers. You basically just had an
[00:05:56] IDE and then programmers did stuff in
[00:05:59] all the different languages, but you
[00:06:00] didn't have like, oh, here's a tool for
[00:06:01] Python, here's a tool for C++. legal is
[00:06:05] kind of the same way. And so I think a
[00:06:07] lot of why you're seeing traction in
[00:06:10] programming and legal is I think there's
[00:06:11] a lot of analogies of of these workflows
[00:06:13] of they're so textheavy and the
[00:06:15] workflows until you had these models you
[00:06:17] couldn't structure them in the way I
[00:06:19] think you can now.
[00:06:20] >> So one of the directions that people are
[00:06:21] going on the coding side is to build
[00:06:23] things that are being called like
[00:06:24] agentic and it's very early on in terms
[00:06:26] of what agentic means but basically
[00:06:28] being able to deconstruct a logic tree
[00:06:29] in terms of what are the set of actions
[00:06:31] that you need to take in a certain
[00:06:32] situation.
[00:06:33] >> Yeah. and then having the um AI agent go
[00:06:37] back and sort of check each one of those
[00:06:38] items, do it, go on to the next item,
[00:06:40] double check it against the prior one.
[00:06:41] >> Do you do that from a legal perspective
[00:06:43] or is that something that's a little bit
[00:06:44] more in the future relative to where
[00:06:45] code is today?
[00:06:46] >> Yeah, we're starting to do this now. And
[00:06:48] actually,
[00:06:49] >> like when I was at DeepMind, a lot of
[00:06:52] the RL research I did was that. And so
[00:06:55] when we first got access to GB4, we had
[00:06:58] the very strong intuition of okay,
[00:07:00] you're going to be able to, you know,
[00:07:01] string a bunch of these model calls or
[00:07:03] eventually do things like reasoning
[00:07:04] models where the full agent is
[00:07:06] differentiable. And even the first day
[00:07:10] we got access to GPD4, Winston went in
[00:07:13] his room for 14 hours and just redid a
[00:07:15] bunch of his associate tasks. And when I
[00:07:17] looked at the work he was doing, it was
[00:07:20] essentially like this hacky aogentic
[00:07:22] where he said, "Okay, I would need to go
[00:07:24] look up this case law, summarize it,
[00:07:26] take that summary, use it to draft."
[00:07:28] >> And so seeing him do that gave us the
[00:07:30] intuition very early on of that's the
[00:07:32] direction this is going. And you can
[00:07:34] kind of think of associates as agents.
[00:07:37] They get this task from a partner
[00:07:38] that's, "Hey, I have this highle case
[00:07:41] strategy. I want to see if I can find a
[00:07:43] bunch of case law that supports it. Can
[00:07:44] you go research that? look it up, cite
[00:07:46] it,
[00:07:47] >> write me a memo. And so a lot of the
[00:07:49] systems we're starting to build look a
[00:07:51] lot like that. And I I think one
[00:07:53] interesting direction that the coding
[00:07:55] labs, the research labs are going is
[00:07:57] building these RL environments where you
[00:08:00] deploy these agents and they can
[00:08:01] interact with a codebase and see if they
[00:08:03] can pass unit tests. And in legal that
[00:08:06] RL environment is a client matter. So
[00:08:09] you have all of the context of a fund
[00:08:11] formation, an acquisition, a litigation,
[00:08:14] and the models are starting to learn,
[00:08:17] let me go in the document management
[00:08:19] system and see if I can find this, go in
[00:08:20] the data room or do case law research,
[00:08:23] get feedback from the partner. And so I
[00:08:25] think that research direction is is
[00:08:27] super super interesting. And
[00:08:28] >> it's really interesting you make the
[00:08:29] associate analogy because I remember um
[00:08:31] when I led your guys' series B, which I
[00:08:34] think was maybe two years ago now, it's
[00:08:35] a while ago. I called a lot of your big
[00:08:37] customers and talked to the head of the
[00:08:39] law firm or talked to the head of you
[00:08:41] know um some of these institutions and
[00:08:43] one of the things that I thought was
[00:08:44] really striking is number one they were
[00:08:46] adopting legal software which before was
[00:08:48] really hard to sell into them and
[00:08:49] because of what you were doing being so
[00:08:50] striking and important they were
[00:08:51] adopting you really fast the second is
[00:08:54] um they weren't uh threatened by it and
[00:08:56] I was I thought oh they'd be threatened
[00:08:58] because it may augment or eventually
[00:09:00] replace certain aspects of law etc or or
[00:09:02] you know help sort of change that
[00:09:03] dramatically and one of the insight they
[00:09:06] kept bringing up that I thought was
[00:09:07] really interesting is they said as we
[00:09:08] think ahead as this sort of AI tooling
[00:09:11] and agentic workflow spread through
[00:09:12] Harvey and companies like you um how do
[00:09:16] you think about the future of a law firm
[00:09:17] because instead of hiring a 100red
[00:09:19] associates of which you assume 10 will
[00:09:20] be partners eventually maybe you only
[00:09:22] need 50 maybe you only need 20
[00:09:24] >> and so are you even hiring enough people
[00:09:26] to know who'd be a great partner
[00:09:28] >> because you're you're going to shrink
[00:09:30] the set of people that are needed to do
[00:09:31] certain tasks over time right right now
[00:09:32] that isn't true it's augmentation it's
[00:09:34] expanding business but that could happen
[00:09:35] in the long run. How do you think about
[00:09:37] the future of law or what law firms will
[00:09:39] look like or you know the evolution of
[00:09:40] all that?
[00:09:41] >> Yeah, this this is a great question. I
[00:09:42] think it's changed a lot in the past
[00:09:45] couple years. I think something we are
[00:09:47] starting to talk with law firms a lot is
[00:09:51] how do we think of training the future
[00:09:52] generation of partners where to your
[00:09:54] point these law firms have these
[00:09:56] leverage ratios where you have a lot of
[00:09:58] associates but much less partners and
[00:10:01] there is value to that because not
[00:10:02] everyone is going to become a partner
[00:10:04] and part of going through that process
[00:10:05] is how you find oh this is the person
[00:10:08] that I would trust to do this very
[00:10:09] complex acquisition because they've gone
[00:10:11] through that experience and so I think
[00:10:14] the part I'm optimistic about is if I
[00:10:16] think about over 10 years ago when I
[00:10:19] learned to program it was super painful
[00:10:22] right like you had to go on Stack
[00:10:23] Overflow it was hard to learn multiple
[00:10:25] languages because you're like okay I'm
[00:10:27] just going to like learn Python I'm
[00:10:28] going to learn TensorFlow or it was just
[00:10:30] like hard to even learn that it was hard
[00:10:32] to ask questions when I was at Google
[00:10:34] you don't want to ask a bunch of
[00:10:35] questions because people be like oh you
[00:10:36] don't know that I think
[00:10:38] >> stuck all the time
[00:10:38] >> yeah exactly and now with the models
[00:10:40] it's like programming is so fun to learn
[00:10:43] because you can just be like here's how
[00:10:45] to write this in Python, translate it,
[00:10:47] why is it written this way? And you can
[00:10:48] learn this so much more quickly.
[00:10:50] >> And we see lawyers doing that with
[00:10:52] Harvey where they'll say, generate this
[00:10:54] merger agreement, why did we structure
[00:10:56] it that way? And so, we're already
[00:10:58] starting to see some of that. But I
[00:11:00] think the really big opportunity for law
[00:11:01] firms is how do they take all of the
[00:11:04] internal partner feedback and data that
[00:11:06] they've created and use that to start
[00:11:08] training. I think that's one big piece.
[00:11:11] I think another conversation we're
[00:11:13] having is to your point, how do you just
[00:11:15] generally start restructuring firms? I
[00:11:18] think this is one where we have some
[00:11:21] intuitions, but a lot of it is going to
[00:11:23] depend on the firm, the region, the
[00:11:25] size, their specialty, the types of
[00:11:27] clients they serve. I think one of the
[00:11:29] things that's very challenging with law
[00:11:30] firms is they are really a collection of
[00:11:33] all these practice areas. And so the
[00:11:35] firms that specialize in litigation look
[00:11:37] different than the firms that specialize
[00:11:38] in large transactions versus like
[00:11:41] midsize transactions. And usually the
[00:11:43] big firms do a collection of these. And
[00:11:45] so a lot of what we're spending time is
[00:11:47] practice area by practice area. Can we
[00:11:49] go and sit with here's the fund
[00:11:51] formation group and their private equity
[00:11:53] clients and start thinking about what
[00:11:55] that would look like in terms of the
[00:11:57] workflows, the staffing, the pricing.
[00:11:59] Mhm.
[00:11:59] >> Uh and I think it is a really
[00:12:01] interesting problem where a lot of the
[00:12:04] value in the product and the platform is
[00:12:06] not just the product itself, but how do
[00:12:09] we help enable these firms to transform?
[00:12:13] And so when you think about it from that
[00:12:15] perspective, like our goal is how do we
[00:12:18] make these law firms more profitable?
[00:12:20] And it's not just a product problem.
[00:12:22] It's thinking about their holistic
[00:12:23] business and where do we fit in in kind
[00:12:25] of that bigger picture. Mhm.
[00:12:26] >> Yeah. It's really interesting because
[00:12:27] when you look at the set of functions
[00:12:28] that a partner fills and I'm I'm
[00:12:30] thinking in particular of consulting
[00:12:31] firms and less about law firms simply
[00:12:33] because I'm a little bit more uh
[00:12:34] familiar with consultancies uh some of
[00:12:36] it's the pattern recognition, the high
[00:12:38] level thinking, the strategy and then
[00:12:40] part of it is like the sales.
[00:12:42] >> Yeah.
[00:12:42] >> And really being able to make that
[00:12:43] client connection and and so it's
[00:12:45] interesting to to your point think about
[00:12:46] more broadly how can AI augment all
[00:12:48] parts of their business versus just the
[00:12:49] the legal workflows.
[00:12:50] >> Yeah. And to your point, I don't think
[00:12:52] that part changes where it's like when
[00:12:54] we think of the like we're now larger
[00:12:57] consumers of legal services and when we
[00:12:59] think of the best partners we've worked
[00:13:01] with, I don't think the models are doing
[00:13:03] Yeah.
[00:13:03] >> what they do anytime soon. And I think
[00:13:05] what's interesting is I think the role
[00:13:06] of law firm partners actually doesn't
[00:13:09] change that much in the same way I don't
[00:13:11] think the role of very senior engineers
[00:13:13] changes with this because you're largely
[00:13:15] delegating work and what you're getting
[00:13:17] paid to do is here's the highle strategy
[00:13:20] here's the right abstractions go write
[00:13:22] the code or write do the legal research
[00:13:24] to help me do it and I will interface
[00:13:26] with the client and so I think that my
[00:13:28] guess is that doesn't change too much
[00:13:30] but some of the like lower level
[00:13:32] functions do change because of this
[00:13:34] technology One of the things that you
[00:13:35] said that I thought was interesting like
[00:13:37] in another conversation um that we were
[00:13:39] having was that there's an analogy that
[00:13:41] you could make between like a great
[00:13:43] senior partner like a Gordon Moody type
[00:13:45] and like a distinguished engineer
[00:13:47] working on systems at Google, right? Um
[00:13:49] I think for a more technical audience or
[00:13:52] just general business audience that
[00:13:53] doesn't really know what Gordon Moody
[00:13:55] does, they might assume what Alad said
[00:13:56] which is like isn't like 50% of that
[00:13:58] like his network, right? Or his
[00:14:00] reputation? Um, but you know what you
[00:14:03] were pointing out is like there's
[00:14:04] expertise in the ability to predict like
[00:14:06] a sequence of arguments that is going to
[00:14:08] like get you to the answer you want or
[00:14:10] manage risk.
[00:14:11] >> Exactly.
[00:14:12] >> Um, how does that how does that
[00:14:13] translate to an RL environment or a task
[00:14:15] for you?
[00:14:16] >> Yeah, this is a good question. So for
[00:14:18] maybe for background context for the
[00:14:19] audience, Gordon Moody was a partner at
[00:14:22] WCTEL, which is one of the top
[00:14:24] transactional firms in the world that
[00:14:26] joined us early on and is now an
[00:14:28] adviser. And kind of the analogy I was
[00:14:31] giving is why is a senior distinguished
[00:14:36] uh distributed systems engineer at
[00:14:38] Google so valuable? And a lot of it is
[00:14:40] the experience they have architecting
[00:14:42] these systems that none of this is
[00:14:45] public. this will won't go into the
[00:14:46] models for a long time. And so if you're
[00:14:49] building search at Google, these people
[00:14:50] can just point out, hey, if you build
[00:14:52] this system this way at this scale, it's
[00:14:54] going to collapse for some reason. That
[00:14:56] is super not intuitive.
[00:14:58] >> And one of the examples that Gordon
[00:15:01] talked about early on was he was a part
[00:15:04] of uh when Michael Dell took Dell
[00:15:07] private and then restructured it and
[00:15:09] took it public again. And this was like
[00:15:11] a multi-year
[00:15:14] super complex financial and legal
[00:15:16] restructuring of an incredibly large
[00:15:19] business. And what he when you talk with
[00:15:22] him is incredibly good at is the same
[00:15:23] feeling as when you talk with a very
[00:15:25] senior engineer where he can just he has
[00:15:28] the whole picture of this legal entity
[00:15:30] in his head.
[00:15:31] >> At the time they had to do the largest
[00:15:32] debt offering of all time. They had to
[00:15:34] create they had to invent a new
[00:15:35] financial instrument. And so it's just
[00:15:37] understanding if I need to raise this
[00:15:39] much money to do this part of the
[00:15:41] transaction, this is how I would
[00:15:43] structure it. And so a lot of the value
[00:15:45] he brings is not just the relationship,
[00:15:47] but it's just that technical
[00:15:49] understanding of how you architect these
[00:15:51] things the same way that how you
[00:15:53] architect like very large software
[00:15:55] projects. And I think when that
[00:15:56] translates to an RL environment, part of
[00:15:59] what is missing from the public models
[00:16:03] is the process of looking at one of
[00:16:08] these entities and figuring out given
[00:16:10] all of the context of I want to do this
[00:16:13] merger. This is the right way to
[00:16:15] structure it. Just that process and a
[00:16:17] lot
[00:16:17] >> it's a reasoning trace, right, for an
[00:16:19] expert just like it would be in code.
[00:16:21] >> Yeah. And if you looked at that data set
[00:16:23] for one of those transactions, it would
[00:16:25] be client comes to Gordon says, I want
[00:16:27] to do this large merger acquisition and
[00:16:30] then there would be meetings and emails
[00:16:32] talking about, okay, this is the
[00:16:34] background of the two companies. This is
[00:16:36] roughly how we would structure them.
[00:16:37] These are all the things we need to look
[00:16:39] into. And a lot of the data would be
[00:16:42] Gordon giving these tasks to associates
[00:16:44] to say, okay, look into these risk
[00:16:45] factors of similar transactions we've
[00:16:47] done. they would do research and say,
[00:16:49] "Okay, maybe we could structure it this
[00:16:50] way." And then he would point out this
[00:16:52] really subtle thing that, "Hey,
[00:16:54] actually, in this case, if you
[00:16:55] structured it this way, this thing's
[00:16:57] going to happen."
[00:16:58] >> But none of that shows up. Like all you
[00:17:01] get from these public mergers is like an
[00:17:03] SEC filing. And so you do see the final
[00:17:06] result, but most of the
[00:17:08] >> value or what you need, I think, to
[00:17:10] eventually improve these models is the
[00:17:13] decision-m process. the same way you
[00:17:14] need these reasoning traces to to train
[00:17:16] these models to do kind of any of these
[00:17:18] reasoning tasks.
[00:17:19] >> One of the as you mentioned like the
[00:17:22] labs are all very focused on um uh RL
[00:17:26] scaling in um like coding and math
[00:17:29] domains. Yeah.
[00:17:30] >> Um I think of those as like highly
[00:17:32] verifiable right not perfectly so but
[00:17:34] like how how do you think about the
[00:17:36] appropriateness of like law for
[00:17:38] >> RL given it's not as easily verifiable?
[00:17:41] Yeah, this this is one of the biggest
[00:17:43] problems and I remember we had
[00:17:44] conversations early on when we were
[00:17:45] trying to figure out what is the right
[00:17:47] evaluation structure. So I think the
[00:17:50] hardest thing about legal is most of
[00:17:52] these tasks are very long form text
[00:17:55] generation. And so there are definitely
[00:17:59] subsets of legal work that are super
[00:18:01] verifiable of go in this data room and
[00:18:03] just find all the change of control
[00:18:04] provisions that you can kind of build
[00:18:06] these traditional data sets. But for
[00:18:08] something like generate this merger
[00:18:10] agreement,
[00:18:11] >> it's really hard to just give some
[00:18:13] binary like this is good or this is bad.
[00:18:15] >> And I think this has been like a big
[00:18:17] research problem like with all the labs
[00:18:18] we work with and also internally there
[00:18:20] is just this open question of how do you
[00:18:22] build that reward function? And if you
[00:18:25] think of what that reward function is at
[00:18:26] the law firms, it's the partners, right?
[00:18:29] Like at the end of the day, there is no
[00:18:30] way to verify this besides this senior
[00:18:32] partner who's done a bunch of these
[00:18:34] said, "Yeah, this looks pretty good." M
[00:18:36] >> and so internally these law firms have a
[00:18:38] bunch of data of here's all the edits
[00:18:41] that went into this and the feedback and
[00:18:43] so we are starting to think about how do
[00:18:45] you use that to train these reward
[00:18:48] functions but I would say that is one of
[00:18:50] the really big problems but I think one
[00:18:52] of the interesting things is I think you
[00:18:55] actually have the same problem in
[00:18:56] programming where I think in the short
[00:18:59] term programming is verifiable where you
[00:19:01] can look at unit tests but once you get
[00:19:03] into real software engineering like the
[00:19:05] unit. There is no unit test. It's like I
[00:19:07] deployed system design.
[00:19:08] >> Yeah. It's like I deployed this and a
[00:19:10] million users used it for six months and
[00:19:12] it didn't crash. And so you get and and
[00:19:14] it's like mergers are the same where
[00:19:16] it's like you can make sure the filing
[00:19:18] is correct. But at the end of the day
[00:19:19] it's like 3 years later the companies
[00:19:21] are still merged and they didn't take on
[00:19:23] litigation they didn't expect or
[00:19:24] something like that. And it's like that
[00:19:26] is eventually the really valuable human
[00:19:29] experience, right? That's what you pay
[00:19:30] really good software engineers or really
[00:19:32] good lawyers where they have that
[00:19:34] decadel long track record of they can
[00:19:36] build these systems and they haven't
[00:19:38] fallen apart and a lot of these stuff
[00:19:40] the same way you can't unit test it's
[00:19:41] like hard to verify. So it is I think
[00:19:44] this really interesting open research
[00:19:45] problem. One thing that you guys are
[00:19:48] doing on sort of the um other end from
[00:19:51] pushing the bounds of uh what Harvey
[00:19:54] products and um the models can do is
[00:19:56] like just get them deployed and uh you
[00:19:59] recently started this for deployed
[00:20:01] engineering force. Yeah.
[00:20:02] >> Um this is [clears throat] confusing to
[00:20:03] to me because I'm like well you're not
[00:20:05] necessarily like an application building
[00:20:08] company which is how people have
[00:20:09] traditionally thought of FTE. Like why
[00:20:11] are you doing this? I would say the
[00:20:14] model that we're operating under is not
[00:20:16] a full palunteer let's go into the
[00:20:18] codebase and kind of build custom
[00:20:21] software.
[00:20:22] >> Uh I I would say this is closer to like
[00:20:24] Sierra's agent engineering um program.
[00:20:27] But what we're starting to run into a
[00:20:30] lot is I think early on we did a really
[00:20:33] good job of building a horizontal
[00:20:35] platform. We did not that much
[00:20:38] customization for customers in the sense
[00:20:41] of building specific things for specific
[00:20:43] customers. I think the thing that was
[00:20:45] nice about legal was we could build
[00:20:48] things like workflow builder and things
[00:20:51] into the product that would let
[00:20:52] customers customize the product. And
[00:20:54] then for very large customers like PWC,
[00:20:56] we did some customization.
[00:20:59] But now we're getting to the point where
[00:21:01] when we're starting to talk with law
[00:21:03] firms about, hey, we want to take a
[00:21:05] bunch of this data and help you build a
[00:21:07] model or build agents, there is some
[00:21:10] amount of we need to go in this
[00:21:11] environment into your environment and
[00:21:13] figure out how to connect all the data.
[00:21:15] We're starting to connect to a lot of
[00:21:16] their like business systems. So their
[00:21:18] billing systems, governance systems, and
[00:21:21] then especially when we start working
[00:21:23] with the Walmarts, the very large banks,
[00:21:25] the Fortune 500, they're much less
[00:21:28] standardized than these law firms. And
[00:21:29] so there is just this massive amount of
[00:21:31] work where we go to a large bank and
[00:21:33] they say, "We don't have any document
[00:21:35] management system for our legal
[00:21:36] department. Can you just build us one?"
[00:21:38] Mhm.
[00:21:39] >> And there is a massive amount of demand
[00:21:43] of we just want smart technical people
[00:21:46] to sit here and help us think about our
[00:21:49] business and our operations and how we
[00:21:51] should start mapping that into Gen AI
[00:21:54] systems. And for us it's a really good
[00:21:56] way to figure out the roadmap where for
[00:21:59] example Blue Owl is like one of the
[00:22:01] fastest growing private equity firms
[00:22:03] that uh we recently started working with
[00:22:06] and they we meet with them all the time
[00:22:09] and they're just like there's all these
[00:22:10] things that we feel like we could map
[00:22:12] into Gen AI. We don't quite know what
[00:22:15] it's going to look like but let's just
[00:22:16] sit together and figure it out. And so I
[00:22:18] would say that's a lot of the genesis of
[00:22:19] the of the program of how do we just get
[00:22:22] more people that can work with all these
[00:22:23] customers and start kind of paving the
[00:22:25] way of some of these new road maps in
[00:22:27] different verticals.
[00:22:28] >> Yeah. I think what you're describing too
[00:22:29] is a very standard enterprise playbook.
[00:22:33] >> And I think in Silicon Valley people
[00:22:34] almost forgot because of the SAS era
[00:22:37] that if you're Oracle, if you're Dell,
[00:22:39] if you're IBM, if you're any of these
[00:22:41] larger organizations, this is how you
[00:22:43] sell software.
[00:22:44] >> Exactly.
[00:22:44] >> Right. You have a platform, you have a
[00:22:46] bunch of customization around it. people
[00:22:47] have bespoke data sets. They may not
[00:22:48] always have the ability internally or
[00:22:50] enough people to implement certain
[00:22:51] connectors or systems,
[00:22:53] >> right?
[00:22:53] >> And this is like the standard way to do
[00:22:54] it. And then as you do it over and over
[00:22:55] again, you start repeatedly turning that
[00:22:57] into part of the platform. And so
[00:22:58] >> and and I I think a lot of these started
[00:23:01] with doing something that resembled FD
[00:23:03] and then you get big enough that you get
[00:23:05] this like implementation ecosystem.
[00:23:08] There's all these third parties that
[00:23:09] will come in and implement.
[00:23:10] >> It'll be like the certified like vendor.
[00:23:13] And and I think the interesting thing
[00:23:15] we're actually starting to see is law
[00:23:16] firms are starting to do this for their
[00:23:18] in-house clients. So they're starting to
[00:23:20] go and take Harvey and go to their
[00:23:22] clients and say, "Hey, buy Harvey and
[00:23:25] we'll help you build all the workflows
[00:23:26] and implement it because we have the
[00:23:29] scale and the expertise to build this
[00:23:30] where typically these in-house teams,
[00:23:32] the smaller ones don't have like the
[00:23:34] budget or the in-house to build this."
[00:23:36] >> And so yeah, I think there is kind of a
[00:23:38] >> that could be a good revenue driver for
[00:23:39] the law firms that you work with in
[00:23:41] terms of a new line of business that
[00:23:42] they can offer. Yeah. And some of them
[00:23:44] are starting to think about it that way.
[00:23:45] >> Yeah.
[00:23:45] >> I was really struck by it wasn't I don't
[00:23:47] know if it was day zero, you can correct
[00:23:49] me, but it was within the first year
[00:23:51] where the very first version of Harvey
[00:23:54] was really an individual lawyer
[00:23:55] productivity tool, right? Uh I'm an
[00:23:57] associate or a more senior personal law
[00:23:59] firm. I want to get a piece of work
[00:24:00] done. Can you just make it less painful?
[00:24:02] Uh but the transition quickly to like
[00:24:05] how do we transform the business, make
[00:24:06] the business more profitable, like
[00:24:08] organized teams being the ecosystem I
[00:24:11] think happened pretty quickly and like
[00:24:14] anything that is a business
[00:24:16] transformation just requires like
[00:24:19] >> you know a lot of engagement.
[00:24:20] >> Yeah.
[00:24:20] >> Um and so I I given how much you guys
[00:24:23] have invested in customer success and
[00:24:25] how that's like driven adoption, I feel
[00:24:27] like a big piece of it is just how
[00:24:28] quickly AI has happened.
[00:24:29] >> Yeah.
[00:24:30] >> Right. I I would not necessarily have
[00:24:32] predicted that all the customers you're
[00:24:34] working with would be like yes in year
[00:24:36] one and two of this company selling
[00:24:38] we're adopting. Yeah.
[00:24:39] >> Um but you know part of it is you guys
[00:24:41] are helping them right.
[00:24:42] >> Yeah. No and I I think this was like
[00:24:45] when I look back it was still surprising
[00:24:47] how quickly some of these law firms
[00:24:49] adopted this. like our first customer we
[00:24:51] actually met through you introd
[00:24:56] school here and he introed us to David
[00:24:58] Wakeling at ANO that was in our first
[00:25:01] year and they went from a small pilot to
[00:25:03] firmwide and investing in this and I
[00:25:05] think I mean I think you're seeing this
[00:25:07] in a couple verticals with like cursor
[00:25:09] open evidence where this technology is
[00:25:11] so transformative for these industries
[00:25:13] that just are so techs heavy and
[00:25:16] knowledge based they just haven't had
[00:25:17] tools like this that I think Early on,
[00:25:20] we did find these customers that were
[00:25:22] like, "Oh, this is worth really betting
[00:25:24] on, but yeah, I think the pace has still
[00:25:26] been pretty surprising."
[00:25:27] >> I asked the internet through X, uh, what
[00:25:30] questions we should ask you. Um, and a
[00:25:32] popular one was like, "Why aren't you
[00:25:35] guys building a law firm? Are you going
[00:25:36] to build a law firm and compete with all
[00:25:38] your customers?"
[00:25:39] >> Yeah. No, we we get this question and I
[00:25:42] mean I think when we first started
[00:25:45] Harvey and we were doing research, we
[00:25:46] actually talked to 30 people from Atrium
[00:25:50] and I think also interestingly Sam and
[00:25:53] uh Jason who was the GC of OpenAI at the
[00:25:56] time
[00:25:56] >> and was the GC at Y Combinator when they
[00:25:58] did the Atrium investment. What struck
[00:26:00] us was the people who worked there said
[00:26:02] it was a really good idea and they were
[00:26:06] super excited about the prospects and
[00:26:07] then there were some challenges around
[00:26:08] the legal and the execution. But when we
[00:26:11] dug more into it, the big challenge that
[00:26:14] they ran into was you're essentially
[00:26:16] just building two different companies,
[00:26:17] right? You're building a law firm and
[00:26:19] you're building a tech company.
[00:26:21] >> And it's already really hard to like
[00:26:23] build product engineering, do AI, scale
[00:26:26] sales. And I think the big issue you run
[00:26:28] into if you try to do both of these is I
[00:26:31] think you can only do one thing well and
[00:26:34] doing a law firm well is very different
[00:26:36] than building a software company well. I
[00:26:38] think that's one point. The bigger point
[00:26:40] is
[00:26:42] for us it feels like the best outcome is
[00:26:45] if we can figure out how do we make
[00:26:47] every law firm how do we help every law
[00:26:49] firm become an AI first law firm not how
[00:26:52] do we build one ourselves and I think
[00:26:53] the real problem we're trying to solve
[00:26:55] is can we make every law firm more
[00:26:58] profitable and a part of that is how
[00:27:01] they work with their clients and can you
[00:27:04] make their clients get better faster
[00:27:06] cheaper legal services and I think
[00:27:07] solving that equation at scale is a much
[00:27:10] bigger opportunity than if you build a
[00:27:13] single law firm because you get
[00:27:14] conflicted out. You can't scale this.
[00:27:16] And so I think this is probably like
[00:27:18] this is something we don't do but we've
[00:27:20] gotten this question but yeah I I think
[00:27:22] it's kind of not the focus for the
[00:27:24] company.
[00:27:24] >> Analogous to other uh markets in
[00:27:27] software. Um law feels like an area
[00:27:30] where I've been very surprised
[00:27:32] personally about how how large the scope
[00:27:35] of the problem is eventually if you're
[00:27:36] really ambitious about what you can do.
[00:27:38] Um, I didn't realize like you you were
[00:27:40] telling me, you know, if you do a really
[00:27:42] large M&A, let's say of like two global
[00:27:44] companies, Microsoft, Activision or
[00:27:46] something, you're like there's a hundred
[00:27:48] outside council firms here. You know
[00:27:50] why? Because in New Zealand, where both
[00:27:52] companies have customers, you have like
[00:27:54] a tax implication, and the dude who
[00:27:56] understands that lives in New Zealand,
[00:27:57] right?
[00:27:58] >> Yeah. Oh, it's Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:27:59] >> And and so I I think like, you know,
[00:28:01] like other markets, like the SMB version
[00:28:03] of this looks really different from the
[00:28:05] like high-end enterprise version of
[00:28:06] this.
[00:28:07] >> Yeah. Um, and so I I do think it's like
[00:28:10] hard. It just seems hard to imagine like
[00:28:12] coalesing all of that expertise in a law
[00:28:14] firm and a software company at the same
[00:28:16] time versus I'm like, well, Harvey now
[00:28:18] has like what 40 customers in New
[00:28:20] Zealand.
[00:28:20] >> Exact. Yeah. And and I mean, if you
[00:28:22] think about those transactions, it's
[00:28:24] also not just law firms. So there's
[00:28:26] investment banks and you maybe have PWC
[00:28:28] or a tax advisor and there could be an
[00:28:31] HR consultancy that helps you think
[00:28:34] about how you're merging headcount. And
[00:28:36] >> so for us the bigger opportunity seems
[00:28:38] how do we build the platform that lets
[00:28:40] professional service providers and their
[00:28:43] clients collaborate
[00:28:44] >> and I think a lot of the problems you
[00:28:46] need to solve there are like the biggest
[00:28:49] is the secure collaboration across many
[00:28:52] of these entities the secure data
[00:28:54] sharing. How do you build and deploy AI
[00:28:56] systems across these very complex
[00:28:58] projects? And I think to your point, the
[00:29:01] scope of this, like legal is a trillion,
[00:29:04] professional services is something like
[00:29:05] 3 to 5 trillion. There's just this
[00:29:07] massive amount of room to grow. And we
[00:29:11] think our expertise is going to be in
[00:29:12] building the product, the technical
[00:29:15] systems, the AI systems that enable
[00:29:17] that. and we want to give that
[00:29:20] infrastructure to all of the different
[00:29:21] law firms rather than compete with them
[00:29:23] because I just don't think you can. I
[00:29:25] >> think one of the things that's really
[00:29:26] striking um about this sort of wave or
[00:29:29] era of AI is that there's deeply
[00:29:31] technical people building giant
[00:29:34] companies in really different
[00:29:35] industries.
[00:29:36] >> Yeah.
[00:29:37] >> And you come from a research background.
[00:29:39] You worked at one of the major labs in
[00:29:41] terms of foundation models and other
[00:29:43] areas, RL environments, reinforcement
[00:29:45] learning. What has been your biggest
[00:29:46] surprise in terms of transitioning into
[00:29:48] being a founder and running a company
[00:29:49] and building something from the ground
[00:29:50] up like that?
[00:29:51] >> I think maybe maybe not surprise but
[00:29:54] biggest like mental model shift is I
[00:29:57] think the 10 years before Harvey I was
[00:30:00] doing a mix of mainly AI research and
[00:30:03] then trying to start companies but
[00:30:04] always largely as an IC. Mhm.
[00:30:06] >> And I think the shift from this started
[00:30:09] working and scaling just how much I had
[00:30:12] to change my mental model of the type of
[00:30:15] company we're building, how you do this
[00:30:17] at scale, how you operate. I think that
[00:30:19] was the biggest
[00:30:20] >> surprise or like thing that I've had to
[00:30:23] had to change. But it's been a crazy
[00:30:25] experience kind of going from, you know,
[00:30:27] Winston and I in an Airbnb to 500 people
[00:30:31] in like three and a half years. Then I
[00:30:33] think also how you build these products
[00:30:36] at scale and kind of the complexity of
[00:30:38] this industry like that has been like a
[00:30:40] really hard but interesting experience.
[00:30:42] >> It's been amazing to see what you all
[00:30:43] have accomplished. you know, it's it's
[00:30:45] such a short period of time. And
[00:30:46] >> I I was thinking back to like when we
[00:30:48] pitched to both of you guys like three
[00:30:50] and a half years ago and we were like,
[00:30:52] "Hey, AI plus for legal." And you guys
[00:30:54] were like, "Sounds good." But we like I
[00:30:56] mean, we had some of these ideas, but I
[00:30:58] think they've really like
[00:31:00] >> I think a really important aspect of
[00:31:01] that too is um you all started this
[00:31:03] company
[00:31:04] >> um before GPT4 came out and before a lot
[00:31:08] of the shifts in the models happened.
[00:31:09] And so I remember you showing side by
[00:31:11] side GPD 3.5 versus 4 and what you were
[00:31:14] doing worked on four but not on 3.5.
[00:31:16] >> Yeah.
[00:31:16] >> And you were part of that very early
[00:31:17] wave that had conviction this was so
[00:31:19] important as a trend. Was that because
[00:31:21] of your experience in the labs? Was it
[00:31:23] something else? Like what drove you
[00:31:24] because not many people were actually
[00:31:25] starting AI companies when you all got
[00:31:27] started.
[00:31:27] >> Yeah.
[00:31:27] >> And it was kind of just to your point AI
[00:31:30] plus legal like nobody was doing that.
[00:31:31] >> Yeah. Yeah. It's something where now
[00:31:33] everyone's like oh this is such an
[00:31:34] obvious idea but at the time Yeah. Yeah.
[00:31:37] Now Yeah. text in, text out. But at the
[00:31:39] time, yeah, no one was thinking about
[00:31:40] this. I think it was a combination of a
[00:31:43] couple things.
[00:31:45] A lot of the best people at the time I
[00:31:47] had worked with had gone to OpenAI and
[00:31:49] so I was working on large language
[00:31:52] models at Meta. You saw GPD 1, GPD2,
[00:31:54] GPD3. If you were working in AI for the
[00:31:57] past 10 years,
[00:31:59] >> kind of one of the big problems were how
[00:32:00] do you pull all this together? because
[00:32:02] you built systems where okay this is
[00:32:03] really good at vision this is really
[00:32:05] good at like specific things but no one
[00:32:07] really had the like general solution and
[00:32:10] you saw saw you saw things like lambda
[00:32:13] >> and I think with that trend like what
[00:32:15] I'd seen is anytime you kind of make
[00:32:17] that initial okay this is how you do it
[00:32:20] you can usually just scale and this
[00:32:22] stuff keeps working and so with 3 3.5
[00:32:26] you were like this is getting really
[00:32:27] interesting but it's not quite there
[00:32:30] >> and so the bet was okay, OpenAI may be
[00:32:34] one of the people to crack it. Like I
[00:32:36] know a lot of the people there.
[00:32:37] >> Uh that was part and then I think the
[00:32:40] other big part was just Winston uh was a
[00:32:43] lawyer and I think we had become super
[00:32:46] close. never thought we'd start a
[00:32:48] company together, but just the way I
[00:32:50] heard him talk about the legal industry.
[00:32:53] Like he, even though he was a first year
[00:32:55] associate, just had this intuition of
[00:32:58] not just the work he was doing, but the
[00:33:00] structure of the firm. Like I would hear
[00:33:02] him talk about the firm and be like,
[00:33:03] "Here's what all the different partners
[00:33:05] are doing. Here's like why our firm
[00:33:07] strategy is this way." He had he was in
[00:33:10] the process of convincing some partners
[00:33:12] to leave to start a law firm with him
[00:33:13] which is insane for like and so it was
[00:33:15] just like okay this will be really fun.
[00:33:17] He showed me a bunch of his legal tech.
[00:33:19] It was like this seems like the perfect
[00:33:21] application and then when we saw GBD4 I
[00:33:23] was just like oh the time is now like
[00:33:25] this is the perfect like application. I
[00:33:28] think it is like really noteworthy uh
[00:33:30] where I was actually like you know even
[00:33:33] six months into um working with you guys
[00:33:36] being like well our capabilities really
[00:33:38] going to advance that quickly and both
[00:33:39] you and Winston were like absolutely
[00:33:41] right like we should we should have the
[00:33:42] ambition to
[00:33:44] >> um take on the full complexity of like
[00:33:47] any type of legal work that's possible
[00:33:49] because the models will keep getting
[00:33:50] better and like that seems like an like
[00:33:52] a like a super obvious mainstream point
[00:33:55] of view today but in I don't know the
[00:33:58] middle of 2022. I think it was like a um
[00:34:01] it was a strong unique intuition to
[00:34:04] have.
[00:34:04] >> Yeah. Yeah. I I think that was something
[00:34:06] we did really well where we just had
[00:34:08] this belief where I think the same that
[00:34:11] you see with the programming products
[00:34:13] where if you had built something where
[00:34:15] it's like all this does is like check
[00:34:18] that your Python code doesn't have bugs
[00:34:20] which you could have done better with
[00:34:21] 3.5 like you wouldn't have built
[00:34:23] something like cursor. And the intuition
[00:34:25] was just these models can help you do
[00:34:27] any programming task in any programming
[00:34:29] language.
[00:34:29] >> And I think we felt that same way in
[00:34:32] legal. And I had a bit of intuition. I
[00:34:35] did like a bit of investment banking,
[00:34:36] private equity. And it was the same
[00:34:37] workflows where you could just do any of
[00:34:40] them with these models. And so I think
[00:34:43] keeping the product open-ended enough
[00:34:45] that it gave us the room that now we can
[00:34:47] build into all these things and and like
[00:34:49] professional other professional
[00:34:51] services. I think that was super
[00:34:52] important. It's a it's a really
[00:34:53] interesting analogy because for code it
[00:34:55] took an extra two years I think for the
[00:34:58] main coding companies to really emerge
[00:35:00] as the ones that are likely to win.
[00:35:02] >> Yeah.
[00:35:02] >> Right. Um and so you folks started I
[00:35:04] think um three and a half years ago and
[00:35:07] you had a product almost immediately and
[00:35:09] you were up and running really fast and
[00:35:10] then I think um cursor didn't really
[00:35:13] launch its IDE until 24 months ago
[00:35:16] something like that.
[00:35:16] >> Yeah, that sounds Yeah.
[00:35:18] >> And then cognition was slightly in that
[00:35:20] era and then obviously cloud code
[00:35:21] >> six months later. And so everything kind
[00:35:23] of came kind of in a time delayed way
[00:35:25] for code even though get up copilot was
[00:35:27] one of the first products and everybody
[00:35:28] knew that that was really important
[00:35:29] >> and I always think that's really
[00:35:30] interesting because there were so many
[00:35:31] coding companies that got started under
[00:35:33] the premise but somehow it's these ones
[00:35:35] that started a little bit later that
[00:35:36] really were the ones who took off and so
[00:35:37] I always wonder why is that
[00:35:39] >> you know what caused that? I my guess is
[00:35:42] my part of my intuition here was just
[00:35:44] you guys were like let's say like very
[00:35:47] um uh AGI is less trendy as we're now
[00:35:49] but very capability build from the
[00:35:51] beginning right so both you Winston and
[00:35:54] you as a shred of an investment banker
[00:35:56] turned AI researcher were both like it's
[00:35:58] going to be able to do so much
[00:36:00] >> the coding people thought that too
[00:36:02] >> yeah they were
[00:36:02] >> I think people were I think people were
[00:36:04] a little less ambitious like three years
[00:36:06] ago at least
[00:36:07] >> some people were going to go and build
[00:36:08] giant models and you know feel like
[00:36:11] >> people were very ambitious. I just think
[00:36:12] that maybe you folks immediately focused
[00:36:14] on product
[00:36:16] >> and that was part of the difference.
[00:36:17] >> I think it was finding the right form
[00:36:19] factor and I think in legal it was maybe
[00:36:21] a bit more obvious where the initial
[00:36:23] form factor was essentially like
[00:36:26] >> like the the initial feature we built
[00:36:28] that none of the products had at the
[00:36:30] time was upload a document and do
[00:36:32] something with it, right? And that is a
[00:36:33] lot of legal tasks.
[00:36:34] >> And it was that and then do really
[00:36:36] accurate citations. And when you showed
[00:36:38] people that they were like, "Oh, this is
[00:36:40] crazy because that's so much of my job."
[00:36:42] I think with coding,
[00:36:44] >> the initial models were also not quite
[00:36:47] as good that you needed maybe a bit more
[00:36:49] capabilities of the base models and then
[00:36:51] you needed I think figuring out the
[00:36:53] right way to like integrate this into
[00:36:54] the into the ID. Yeah, but I mean I
[00:36:56] remember where it's like the first
[00:36:58] version of the product that I built it
[00:37:00] was mainly like I used GPD4 because like
[00:37:03] most of my background was like
[00:37:05] distributed systems and AI research and
[00:37:07] I was I still don't know React. I just
[00:37:09] like JavaScript and kind of like putting
[00:37:11] this together but I'd be like hey GBD4
[00:37:14] like help me make this and like you
[00:37:16] could kind of already see it at the time
[00:37:17] with programming and that was part of
[00:37:19] what gave me the like intuition that I
[00:37:21] could analogize to like what Winston was
[00:37:23] doing. What you mentioned that you folks
[00:37:25] have gone uh from basically the two
[00:37:28] founders to 500 people over the last
[00:37:30] three and a half years or so. You're
[00:37:31] obviously growing really quickly. The
[00:37:33] business is working. You know, you have
[00:37:34] tons of customer demand. Uh what are you
[00:37:36] hiring for? What are you looking for in
[00:37:37] terms of the next set of employees or
[00:37:38] what types of roles are you hiring for
[00:37:40] right now?
[00:37:40] >> Yeah. On the on the technical side, so
[00:37:42] we mentioned FTEEs. I think looking in
[00:37:46] general like across roles of just strong
[00:37:49] engineers and then I would say maybe
[00:37:51] specific callouts. We just hired a site
[00:37:54] lead for New York. So starting to scale
[00:37:55] up that office. Uh more folks on kind of
[00:37:59] front end and scaling product in
[00:38:01] general. And then more AI folks as well.
[00:38:04] So but yeah, anyone strong engineer like
[00:38:07] please apply.
[00:38:08] >> Okay, last question for you.
[00:38:09] >> How many pull-ups can you do?
[00:38:11] >> Just kidding.
[00:38:12] >> We did find out. Yeah. Well, I I don't
[00:38:14] know if that was the max, but these guys
[00:38:16] can both do 15 pull-ups, guys, with a
[00:38:18] wink in the middle.
[00:38:20] >> Okay. Okay. Okay, guys. We get it. Um.
[00:38:23] Uh.
[00:38:23] >> What do you mean in what set?
[00:38:24] >> In [laughter] one set. In one set of
[00:38:26] >> We got to do the 24-hour challenge.
[00:38:28] >> Yeah. Oh, what's that?
[00:38:29] >> Just how many can you do in a day?
[00:38:31] >> No. Really?
[00:38:32] >> Yeah.
[00:38:32] >> It's a lot.
[00:38:33] >> Yeah. You can upload to your Tik Tok.
[00:38:35] >> Put it on the no prior Tik Tok.
[00:38:36] >> Does anyone have a Tik Tok?
[00:38:38] >> No.
[00:38:38] >> Okay. I don't have a Tik Tok. Yeah.
[00:38:41] >> Do you know what Tik Tok is very good
[00:38:42] for?
[00:38:43] >> Arowan videos.
[00:38:44] >> Oh, this is good.
[00:38:45] >> Yeah, that's really good.
[00:38:46] >> Super good.
[00:38:46] >> Yeah, that's some really funny
[00:38:47] >> arrowan videos. like the LA
[00:38:49] >> Yeah. like spoo and or like people like
[00:38:52] like there's one where it's um the Miami
[00:38:54] girl visits.
[00:38:55] >> Oh my god.
[00:38:56] >> She's like Arisant [laughter]
[00:38:58] >> like are you fun?
[00:39:00] >> So it's very good. I highly recommend.
[00:39:02] >> I'll have that sent a couple.
[00:39:04] >> Yeah. No that and Twitter I feel
[00:39:06] >> that's where all my time goes.
[00:39:07] >> Yeah.
[00:39:08] >> Tik Tok everyone videos.
[00:39:10] >> Okay. You can pick We'll pick one of
[00:39:12] these two. I asked some other people
[00:39:13] involved in the company. What questions
[00:39:15] should I ask Gabe?
[00:39:16] >> Oh boy. We covered some of them, but one
[00:39:17] of them was like, "Why do you still
[00:39:18] sleep on an air mattress?"
[00:39:21] >> Okay, so I don't sleep on an air
[00:39:24] mattress. I have a good mattress. I
[00:39:26] don't have a bed frame,
[00:39:28] >> is where that's coming from. And so what
[00:39:30] happened is when we moved from LA to SF,
[00:39:34] my bed frame broke.
[00:39:35] >> Mhm.
[00:39:36] >> And then the first year and a half of
[00:39:38] the startup, things were so crazy. I was
[00:39:40] like, this is what a startup founder
[00:39:41] should do. And at some point, I was
[00:39:43] like, I need to get a bed frame. and I
[00:39:45] ordered one and
[00:39:48] it came and I got a call from the
[00:39:50] apartment and they were like, "Hey, you
[00:39:52] didn't sign out, you didn't fill out the
[00:39:54] insurance, like the rent, the mover's
[00:39:56] insurance, so we can't let them bring
[00:39:57] this up." And I was like, "Okay." I
[00:39:59] called them. I was like, "Hey, do you
[00:40:00] guys have renters's insurance?" They're
[00:40:02] like, "We're UPS. We don't they're just
[00:40:04] like, "We don't do that." And then I was
[00:40:06] just like, "I don't have time to deal
[00:40:07] with it." And I haven't dealt with it.
[00:40:10] [laughter] We have other problems to
[00:40:11] solve. So,
[00:40:12] >> okay. Yeah.
[00:40:13] >> So physically can't do anything except
[00:40:15] the company right now. And
[00:40:16] >> pull-ups. Exactly.
[00:40:18] >> Yeah. Other question was um you know
[00:40:21] there's a bunch of foresight in starting
[00:40:23] Harvey when you guys did when you look
[00:40:25] forward. Do you have a prediction that
[00:40:27] you think others don't necessarily agree
[00:40:29] with you right now that is not
[00:40:31] mainstream. So, one comment I'll
[00:40:33] definitely make on the foresight is I
[00:40:34] think a lot of like we've gotten
[00:40:36] comments of like, oh, overnight success
[00:40:37] and oh, you saw this coming and I would
[00:40:39] say I actually just spent the decade
[00:40:41] before Harvey trying to start a company
[00:40:43] like Harvey. So, I think it was just I
[00:40:45] was super early and then eventually it
[00:40:48] was like, oh, now is the right time and
[00:40:49] then you were kind of in the right
[00:40:50] position.
[00:40:52] I my guess is I think people now are
[00:40:56] catching up to how capability build as
[00:40:59] you called it like Winston and I were. I
[00:41:01] think people in Silicon Valley, I think
[00:41:03] people have a good sense of where these
[00:41:05] models are going, but I think generally
[00:41:08] people don't appreciate how much better
[00:41:10] they're going to continue getting.
[00:41:12] >> It's hard to internalize.
[00:41:14] >> It's really weird. Yeah, it's really
[00:41:15] weird. And
[00:41:16] >> I build things and I'm like, "Oh my god,
[00:41:17] codegen works. It just really works
[00:41:19] now."
[00:41:19] >> It's crazy. Yeah. And I to me it's like
[00:41:21] I think the interesting thing will be
[00:41:22] the transition from like these models
[00:41:25] are really smart individually but if you
[00:41:27] think about like a lot of what we've
[00:41:29] done in the past 20 years with SAS it's
[00:41:31] how do we use software to make these
[00:41:34] massive organizations and I think that
[00:41:36] will be the continued trend where a lot
[00:41:39] of what we're starting to think about is
[00:41:41] like law firms have like 10xed in size
[00:41:43] compared to before computers and the
[00:41:46] internet and I think that's going to
[00:41:47] happen again but in like maybe a
[00:41:50] different way than the past 20 years.
[00:41:52] But I think that to me like a lot of
[00:41:54] people still talk about co-pilots and
[00:41:56] individual productivity and I think a
[00:41:58] lot of the the things we're starting to
[00:42:01] think about is like organizational
[00:42:03] productivity and like how do you build
[00:42:04] these systems at scale where both for
[00:42:07] our internal engineering team like I
[00:42:09] think a really interesting question for
[00:42:11] the for the cursors the codeexes is like
[00:42:14] making someone program 20% faster
[00:42:16] doesn't make you build a product 20%
[00:42:18] faster and so starting to think about
[00:42:20] like what is the broader infraure
[00:42:21] structure you need so these companies
[00:42:23] can develop software and product faster.
[00:42:25] And then kind of same analogy to legal.
[00:42:27] I think that's kind of one of the things
[00:42:29] we're thinking about that I maybe don't
[00:42:31] hear people talk about as much.
[00:42:33] >> Kind of collaborative AI in some sense.
[00:42:35] It's it's sort of like the Figma
[00:42:36] transition of you're individual
[00:42:39] contributor designer versus working
[00:42:40] collaboratively with the design team.
[00:42:42] >> Exactly.
[00:42:42] >> And what you're talking about is doing
[00:42:44] that for law, doing that for code, doing
[00:42:45] that for different verticals and having
[00:42:47] AI as a layer on top of that. So it's
[00:42:48] super interesting.
[00:42:49] >> Yeah. And I I I think to that point,
[00:42:50] it's like how do how are humans and AIs
[00:42:52] going to work super effectively? Because
[00:42:54] even at these large companies, you have
[00:42:56] huge teams of different specialized
[00:42:58] people that have different functions.
[00:43:00] And I think when I hear a lot of people
[00:43:02] talk about these models, they kind of
[00:43:04] talk about as like, oh, AI will just get
[00:43:06] smart and do all of this. And I don't
[00:43:08] think that's the way this evolves the
[00:43:10] same way. It's not just like
[00:43:11] >> hire 100,000 people and now you've built
[00:43:13] Walmart. It's like so much of it is like
[00:43:16] >> million.
[00:43:16] >> How you three mill Yeah. Three million
[00:43:18] actually. Yeah. how you organize all of
[00:43:19] these and I think that will be like one
[00:43:22] of the really interesting problems for
[00:43:23] >> interesting. Yeah, I'm seeing that a lot
[00:43:25] in the context of both AIdriven roll-ups
[00:43:26] as well as this company Brainco that
[00:43:28] >> help get up and running where a lot of
[00:43:30] the AI implementation issues are around
[00:43:33] people management workflow optimization.
[00:43:36] It's it's much less about can you build
[00:43:37] the AI and much more
[00:43:38] >> how do you actually change the
[00:43:39] organization to be able to adopt it
[00:43:41] properly. So
[00:43:42] >> yeah, no and we're starting to work with
[00:43:43] a lot of private equity firms that I
[00:43:45] think it's interesting like starting to
[00:43:46] see how they're thinking about that
[00:43:48] because I think that will be like really
[00:43:49] interesting space.
[00:43:51] >> Awesome. Thanks Gabe.
