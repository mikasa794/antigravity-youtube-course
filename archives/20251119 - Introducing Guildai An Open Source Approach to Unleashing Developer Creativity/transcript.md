[00:00:00] Hi, I'm Michael McBride, a general
[00:00:01] partner here at GV, and I'm here to
[00:00:04] speak with Jim Everingham, and welcome
[00:00:06] him to the GV portfolio as he's just
[00:00:09] formed his new company, Guild AI.
[00:00:11] >> Welcome, Jim.
[00:00:12] >> Thank you, Michael, and thanks, GB, for
[00:00:14] the partnership.
[00:00:14] >> Jim, it's an exciting time. Uh, you've
[00:00:16] you've decided to start a company. I
[00:00:18] would love to hear the vision that led
[00:00:20] to the formation of Guild AI.
[00:00:22] >> The the vision of Guild is pretty
[00:00:23] simple. At the highest level, we just
[00:00:25] want to free up engineers to be able to
[00:00:26] do the things that they love, which is
[00:00:28] innovate, move fast, solve complex
[00:00:31] problems. We want to remove all of the
[00:00:34] work that they don't like to do, the
[00:00:35] friction in the system, the things that
[00:00:37] slow them down. We see a future where
[00:00:39] engineers can go from thought to
[00:00:42] realization instantly. That's going to
[00:00:45] require a new layer. In order to build
[00:00:47] that new layer, we don't think one
[00:00:48] company can do it. It's going to take
[00:00:51] thousands and thousands, hundreds of
[00:00:52] thousands, millions of agents in order
[00:00:54] to be at their command.
[00:00:56] >> Can you expand a little bit on really
[00:00:57] what that means to have engineers coming
[00:00:58] together to build this new platform for
[00:01:00] the AI?
[00:01:01] >> Absolutely. Let's take a specific
[00:01:02] example. Um, AI code review. There's
[00:01:05] lots of companies out trying to solve
[00:01:06] this, trying to build a general agent
[00:01:08] that can code review everything.
[00:01:10] With our recent findings and experience,
[00:01:13] we think that that's probably going to
[00:01:14] take a lot of agents to be able to nail
[00:01:16] effectively. Probably hundreds and
[00:01:18] hundreds of agents. You'll need ones for
[00:01:21] special areas. Like you can imagine
[00:01:23] graphics or security or things like
[00:01:25] that. You need special trained agents.
[00:01:27] So, and I don't think that can be built
[00:01:28] by one company. That's going to have to
[00:01:30] come from a community of developers. Our
[00:01:32] vision is that there needs to be
[00:01:34] something that exists. It's almost like
[00:01:36] the next evolution of open-source where
[00:01:38] engineers used to share code to get
[00:01:41] ideas. Now with AI, they can not only
[00:01:43] share code, but they can share context,
[00:01:46] they can share capability, they can
[00:01:47] share actual intelligence. So we hope
[00:01:50] that guild could become that platform to
[00:01:53] pull all that together.
[00:01:54] >> Earlier this year, you were leading the
[00:01:55] developer infrastructure team at Meta.
[00:01:58] What problems did you notice and what
[00:01:59] inspired you to start Guild AI? The cool
[00:02:02] thing about uh the developer
[00:02:03] infrastructure teams at Meta which were
[00:02:05] pretty unique is that we owned the
[00:02:07] entire development workflow. We have
[00:02:10] tens of thousands of developers. We
[00:02:11] built all the tools everything from
[00:02:13] authoring to land release monitoring and
[00:02:15] deployment. So we had like our own
[00:02:17] closed ecosystem and we could experiment
[00:02:19] very quickly and see what works. Even
[00:02:22] working in the largest one of the
[00:02:23] largest software companies on one of the
[00:02:25] largest sets of infrastructure that
[00:02:26] exists, we hit these limitations of
[00:02:29] scale. We came to the conclusion that
[00:02:31] the only way to do that was a community
[00:02:32] approach that we needed to tap into the
[00:02:35] intelligence and the the expertise of
[00:02:38] specialists globally and that gave us
[00:02:42] the idea that we could build a platform
[00:02:44] to use AI to do that.
[00:02:45] >> For a while we saw a fragmented
[00:02:48] developer tool chain starting to
[00:02:49] consolidate a bit and then with the rise
[00:02:52] of AI it's getting fragmented all over
[00:02:54] again. With that explosion of point
[00:02:56] solutions, do you expect Guild AI is
[00:02:58] going to need to replace those, embrace
[00:03:00] those? Will it amplify all those new
[00:03:02] point solutions? How do you see that
[00:03:04] ecosystem evolving now in the AI era
[00:03:06] where maybe there's a mixture of this
[00:03:08] consolidation and fragmentation that's
[00:03:10] benefit?
[00:03:10] >> That's a real problem. One we're hoping
[00:03:12] to address. There are so many tools out
[00:03:14] there right now. If if you go back even
[00:03:17] a few decades ago, there wasn't that
[00:03:18] many tools. But now there's hundreds of
[00:03:21] thousands if not millions of tools. If I
[00:03:23] go back to meta experience, internally
[00:03:25] we had over 16,000 tools. No developer
[00:03:28] can even know what all those tools are.
[00:03:31] So um you need a platform that will pull
[00:03:34] and have the intelligence to be able to
[00:03:36] help select and even operate those tools
[00:03:38] and for those tools to be able to
[00:03:39] connect together.
[00:03:40] >> And as you embark on solving that
[00:03:43] problem, how do you expect the community
[00:03:45] to participate in this? Uh you're not
[00:03:47] going to do it all yourself.
[00:03:49] >> Um how do you expect that community to
[00:03:51] evolve? Looking at open source in
[00:03:53] general, engineers get a lot of value
[00:03:55] not just from using the components but
[00:03:57] from learning. So they'll look at the
[00:03:59] code. Uh they'll figure it out. They'll
[00:04:01] try to repurpose it and and contribute
[00:04:04] it. They usually don't use it just as it
[00:04:07] is. What we see with now the building of
[00:04:10] agents is that a lot of engineers don't
[00:04:12] even know where to start. There's a lot
[00:04:15] you're trying to build things that have
[00:04:17] intelligence that you may not have.
[00:04:20] So contributing that into a shared
[00:04:22] system is super high value. So building
[00:04:25] a system where people can discover,
[00:04:27] create agents, they can share them.
[00:04:29] Agents can discover agents, they can
[00:04:32] connect and share like this is the type
[00:04:35] of uh uh platform that we're hoping to
[00:04:37] to build with Guild AI.
[00:04:39] >> James, I'm going to pull out my piece of
[00:04:40] paper for this one because we'll do a
[00:04:41] speed round.
[00:04:42] >> Got a number of questions we'll go
[00:04:43] through quickly. Right off at the top,
[00:04:45] are you an AI optimist or AI pessimist?
[00:04:47] So, I'm an optimist, but I also want to
[00:04:49] balance that with some realism of what
[00:04:51] we can do. Now,
[00:04:52] >> what's one thing developers will always
[00:04:55] do better than AI?
[00:04:56] >> They will disagree with their managers.
[00:04:58] Like, I cannot tell you how many times
[00:05:01] in a performance review of someone on
[00:05:03] the team where they're like, "This
[00:05:05] engineer did this. We absolutely told
[00:05:07] him not to do that and they went and did
[00:05:10] it and it led to big impact." Will there
[00:05:12] be more developers in the future or
[00:05:14] fewer? I think there's going to be way
[00:05:17] way more developers. I think they'll be
[00:05:19] able to move at a much faster velocity.
[00:05:21] The only way that I could ever see in my
[00:05:24] mind that not being the case is if
[00:05:26] somehow innovation is finite.
[00:05:28] >> Open or closed systems, who wins?
[00:05:30] >> Open every time.
[00:05:32] >> What's the most overhyped thing in AI
[00:05:34] right now?
[00:05:34] >> Overhyped thing in AI, I would say, is
[00:05:37] the general agent. Like having a general
[00:05:40] agent that can do everything. I don't
[00:05:43] think that that's feasible.
[00:05:45] >> And of course, what's the most
[00:05:46] underhyped?
[00:05:47] >> The most underhyped thing is, I would
[00:05:51] say, are the agents that are addressing
[00:05:53] the 80% of the friction and monotony in
[00:05:57] the tools that are non-coding. See a lot
[00:06:01] in coding, but a lot of the friction in
[00:06:04] the system is non-coding. And I think
[00:06:06] that's pretty underhyped right now.
[00:06:08] >> How will AI change what it means to ship
[00:06:11] software? I think that these systems are
[00:06:13] going to manage your delivery tools
[00:06:15] first off. So, you're not going to have
[00:06:17] to sit and monitor your CI/CD systems
[00:06:20] and do all that or even maybe
[00:06:21] potentially even fix your systems if
[00:06:24] they crash. These might just
[00:06:25] automatically fix themselves. The other
[00:06:28] thing is that the type of software we
[00:06:30] ship may completely change. If you AI
[00:06:34] may add the capability to completely
[00:06:36] change down to a granularity of a single
[00:06:39] customer on what the software delivery
[00:06:40] is.
[00:06:41] >> All right, last one. Why will Guild AI
[00:06:43] win?
[00:06:44] >> We have a really big vision. We think
[00:06:46] that there are going to be hundreds of
[00:06:48] thousands, millions of agents in the
[00:06:50] future and that can't come from one
[00:06:51] company. It's got to come from a robust
[00:06:53] community of builders contributing to
[00:06:56] it. So at Guild, we're going to build a
[00:06:58] platform that brings all of the best
[00:07:00] engineers and the best agents together.
[00:07:02] Uh allows the engineers to interact, to
[00:07:05] collaborate, to learn from the agents,
[00:07:06] and from the agents to even collaborate
[00:07:08] and learn from each other. It's why we
[00:07:10] even named it Guild. It's going to take
[00:07:11] community, it's going to take
[00:07:13] collaboration, it's going to take
[00:07:14] context, and it's going to take craft.
[00:07:16] And we aim to be the platform that
[00:07:19] enables and provides that.
[00:07:21] >> I'm excited about it. This is something
[00:07:22] that I want to exist. I I am so excited
[00:07:25] to see what the builders around the
[00:07:27] world are going to be able to create
[00:07:29] with this kind of capability.
[00:07:30] >> Yeah, we're excited to be on this
[00:07:32] journey and we're excited to share more.
[00:07:34] I can't wait until we can do so. But you
[00:07:37] can go to guild.ai and sign up and uh
[00:07:39] learn when we have more to share.
[00:07:41] >> Jim, I can't tell you how appreciative I
[00:07:43] am that you've welcomed me into this
[00:07:44] journey. I'm excited about it. Um
[00:07:46] congratulations on the quick start and
[00:07:48] I'm looking forward to everything you're
[00:07:49] going to build in the future.
[00:07:50] >> Thank you so much.
