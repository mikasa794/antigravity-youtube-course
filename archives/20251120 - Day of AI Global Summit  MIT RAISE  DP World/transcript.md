[00:00:06] Hi, my name is Ethan Burman. I'm the
[00:00:08] president of Day of AI and I'm thrilled
[00:00:10] to be here in Dubai at the first
[00:00:13] inaugural global day of AI summit hosted
[00:00:16] here at DP World in collaboration with
[00:00:19] MIT Race.
[00:00:24] DP World very much invests into the
[00:00:26] future of the nation. That's one of our
[00:00:27] core principles and values. We're very
[00:00:30] much focused on uh working with MIT and
[00:00:33] many other collaborative bodies to
[00:00:35] ensure that our youngsters are ready for
[00:00:38] the challenges of tomorrow.
[00:00:43] In 2021, we launched our first flagship
[00:00:46] program called the day of AI. And now in
[00:00:48] just 4 years based on this originating
[00:00:51] idea of AI is for everyone. uh through
[00:00:53] our DVI program, we're now in over 170
[00:00:56] countries, have trained over 70,000
[00:00:58] teachers and reached over two million
[00:01:00] children. Everyone here is, you know,
[00:01:03] working together, collaborating, sharing
[00:01:05] best practices, sharing experiences to
[00:01:07] help each other form a global community
[00:01:09] to bring AI literacy to their children
[00:01:12] in a way that cultivates responsible,
[00:01:15] ethical, creative solving and making
[00:01:18] with AI for our future.
[00:01:32] I'm excited about the the movement here
[00:01:35] um because it's about bringing AI um to
[00:01:37] all people um in ways that empowers
[00:01:40] people to do things ethically,
[00:01:41] responsibly, and creatively. The
[00:01:43] community here today are people who are
[00:01:45] both uh you know innovators who have
[00:01:47] already done things in their in their
[00:01:49] countries and their regions brought AI
[00:01:51] into their schools brought AI into their
[00:01:52] communities and those who are looking to
[00:01:54] do that. Um and I think one of the the
[00:01:56] most exciting thing here is not what
[00:01:58] what we bring but what all these people
[00:01:59] bring to the table together.
[00:02:05] I am Oscar Sanchez. and the CEO of
[00:02:07] Computer Espadukar. I'm here in Dubai
[00:02:11] sharing the experience of collaboration
[00:02:12] between MIT Rise and Day of AI with my
[00:02:15] country. I'm so happy because we are
[00:02:17] reaching almost 8 million students in
[00:02:21] more than 42,000 schools in my country.
