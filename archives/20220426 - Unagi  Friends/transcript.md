[00:00:04] oh we went to a self-defense class today
[00:00:07] yeah kicking a guy in the crotch all
[00:00:09] morning really takes it out of you
[00:00:12] takes it out of you
[00:00:15] no now we can kick anybody's ass yeah
[00:00:18] after one class i don't think so what
[00:00:21] you want to see me self-defend myself go
[00:00:23] over there and pretend you're a sexual
[00:00:24] predator go on i dare you
[00:00:28] of course you could defend yourself from
[00:00:30] an attack you know is coming that's not
[00:00:32] enough
[00:00:34] look i studied karate for a long time
[00:00:39] and there's a concept you should really
[00:00:41] be familiar with it's what the japanese
[00:00:43] call
[00:00:44] unagi
[00:00:48] isn't that a kind of sushi
[00:00:51] no it's a concept yeah it is it is it's
[00:00:53] freshwater eel
[00:00:56] all right maybe it means that too oh i
[00:00:58] would kill for a salmon skin roll right
[00:00:59] now
[00:01:02] no fine get attacked i don't even care
[00:01:05] come on ross we're sorry please tell us
[00:01:08] what it is
[00:01:11] unagi
[00:01:13] is a state
[00:01:14] of total awareness
[00:01:16] okay only by achieving true unagi can
[00:01:19] you be prepared for any danger that may
[00:01:22] befall you
[00:01:24] you mean in case someone's trying to
[00:01:26] steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your
[00:01:28] kettle of fish
[00:01:33] all i'm saying is it's one thing being
[00:01:35] prepared for an attack against like each
[00:01:37] other whole other story being prepared
[00:01:40] for an attack i don't know best surprise
[00:01:51] all right you knew that was coming but
[00:01:52] that doesn't mean you have unagi
[00:01:57] [Applause]
[00:01:59] ooh you know what if we made
[00:02:00] reservations we could have unagi in
[00:02:02] about a half hour

[00:02:33] those girlish screams would you have
[00:02:35] begun to kick my ass
[00:02:40] all right so we weren't prepared
[00:02:44] i'm sorry i had to take such drastic
[00:02:46] measures to make my point but i look i
