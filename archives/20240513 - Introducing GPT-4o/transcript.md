[00:00:14] [APPLAUSE] 
[00:00:20] >> MIRA MURATI: Hi everyone.  
[00:00:21] Thank you, thank you.  It is 
[00:00:22] great to have you here today.  
[00:00:25] Today, I am going to talk about 
[00:00:25] three things.  That is it.  We 
[00:00:28] will start with why it is so 
[00:00:31] important to us to have a 
[00:00:36] product that we can make truly 
[00:00:37] available and broadly available 
[00:00:38] to everyone.  And we are always 
[00:00:42] trying to find out ways to 
[00:00:42] reduce friction.  So everyone 
[00:00:44] can use ChatGPT wherever they 
[00:00:48] are.  Today, we will be 
[00:00:49] releasing the desktop version 
[00:00:50] of ChatGPT and to make it 
[00:00:55] simpler to use and much more 
[00:00:56] natural as well.  But the big 
[00:00:58] news today is that we are 
[00:01:00] launching our new flagship 
[00:01:01] model.  And we are calling it 
[00:01:05] GPT-4o.  Best thing about 
[00:01:11] GPT-4o is it brain GPT-4 
[00:01:12] intelligence to everyone 
[00:01:19] including our free users.  We 
[00:01:19] will be showing some live demos 
[00:01:20] today to show the full extent 
[00:01:21] of the capabilities of our new 
[00:01:22] model.  And we will be rolling 
[00:01:23] them out over the next few 
[00:01:26] weeks.  So let's get started.  
[00:01:32] A very important part of our 
[00:01:33] mission is to be able to make 
[00:01:34] our advanced AI tools available 
[00:01:39] to everyone for free.  We think 
[00:01:41] it is very, very important that 
[00:01:47] people having for what the 
[00:01:47] technology can do.  We really 
[00:01:48] want to pair it with its 
[00:01:53] broader understanding.  And 
[00:01:53] were always finding ways to 
[00:01:56] reduce the friction.  Recently, 
[00:01:57] we made ChatGPT available 
[00:02:01] without the sign-up flow.  
[00:02:02] Today, we are also bringing the 
[00:02:03] best to ChatGPT.  We want you 
[00:02:08] to be able to use it wherever 
[00:02:09] you are.  As you can see it is 
[00:02:15] easy, simple, it integrates 
[00:02:16] very, very easily in your 
[00:02:16] workflow.  Along with it, we 
[00:02:17] have also refreshed the UI.  We 
[00:02:27] note that this model get more 
[00:02:27] and more complex.  But we want 
[00:02:28] the experience of interaction 
[00:02:29] to actually become more 
[00:02:31] natural, easy, and for you not 
[00:02:36] to focus on the UI at all but 
[00:02:37] focus on the collaboration of 
[00:02:38] ChatGPT.  And now the big news. 
[00:02:42] Today, we are releasing our 
[00:02:45] newest flagship model this is 
[00:02:51] GPT-4o.  [APPLAUSE] 
[00:02:57] GPT-4o provides GPT-4 
[00:03:01] intelligence but it is much 
[00:03:02] faster.  And it improves on its 
[00:03:04] capabilities across text, 
[00:03:08] vision, and audio.  For the 
[00:03:13] past couple of years, we have 
[00:03:14] been very focused on improving 
[00:03:15] the intelligence of this model 
[00:03:16] is.  And they have gotten 
[00:03:18] pretty good.  But this is the 
[00:03:19] first time that we are really 
[00:03:22] making a huge step forward when 
[00:03:23] it comes to the ease of use.  
[00:03:29] This is incredibly important 
[00:03:30] because we are looking at the 
[00:03:31] future of interaction between 
[00:03:34] ourselves and the machines.  We 
[00:03:34] think that GPT-4o is really 
[00:03:40] shifting the paradigm into the 
[00:03:42] future of collaboration.  It is 
[00:03:45] natural and far easier.  Making 
[00:03:58] this happen is actually quite 
[00:03:59] complex.  When we interact with 
[00:03:59] one another there is a lot of 
[00:04:00] stuff that we take for granted. 
[00:04:01] You know the ease of our 
[00:04:02] dialogue when we interrupt 
[00:04:04] another, the background noises, 
[00:04:05] the multiple voices in a 
[00:04:11] conversation and understanding 
[00:04:12] the tone of voice.  All of 
[00:04:12] these things are quite complex. 
[00:04:16] Until now with voice mode, we 
[00:04:21] had three models that come 
[00:04:21] together to deliver this 
[00:04:23] experience.  We have 
[00:04:24] transcription, intelligence, 
[00:04:28] and text to speech all comes 
[00:04:29] together and orchestration to 
[00:04:30] deliver voice mode.  This also 
[00:04:36] brings a lot of latency to the 
[00:04:37] experience and it really breaks 
[00:04:38] the immersion in the 
[00:04:41] collaboration with ChatGPT.  
[00:04:42] But now with GPT-4o this all 
[00:04:45] happens natively.  GPT-4o 
[00:04:47] reasons across voice, text, and 
[00:04:51] vision.  And with this 
[00:04:57] incredible efficiencies, it 
[00:04:58] also allows us to bring the 
[00:05:07] GPT-4o intelligence to our free 
[00:05:07] users.  This is something we 
[00:05:08] have been trying to do for 
[00:05:09] many, many months.  And we are 
[00:05:10] very, very excited to finally 
[00:05:12] bring GPT-4o to all of our 
[00:05:12] users.  Today, we have 100 
[00:05:18] million people using more than 
[00:05:21] 100 million and fact they use 
[00:05:22] ChatGPT to create work, learn, 
[00:05:26] and we have this advanced tools 
[00:05:29] that are only available to our 
[00:05:35] paid users at least until now 
[00:05:36] with a efficiencies of 4o we 
[00:05:38] can bring these tools to 
[00:05:39] everyone.  So starting today, 
[00:05:40] you can use GPT in the GPT 
[00:05:48] store.  So far we have had more 
[00:05:49] than a million users create 
[00:05:50] amazing experiences with GPT.  
[00:05:58] This is custom ChatGPT and they 
[00:05:59] are available in the store.  
[00:05:59] And now our builders have much 
[00:06:00] bigger audience where 
[00:06:05] university professors can 
[00:06:06] create content for their 
[00:06:09] students, or pod casters can 
[00:06:09] create content for their 
[00:06:10] listeners.  You can also use 
[00:06:15] the vision.  So now you can 
[00:06:16] upload screenshots, photos, 
[00:06:22] documents containing both text 
[00:06:23] and images.  You can start 
[00:06:26] conversations with ChatGPT 
[00:06:27] about all of this content.  You 
[00:06:36] can also use memory where it 
[00:06:37] makes ChatGPT far more useful 
[00:06:38] and helpful because now it has 
[00:06:39] a sense of continuity across 
[00:06:40] all of your conversations.  You 
[00:06:41] can use browse where you can 
[00:06:44] search for real-time 
[00:06:45] information in your 
[00:06:46] conversation.  An advanced data 
[00:06:48] analysis where you can upload 
[00:06:50] charts and any tools and 
[00:06:55] analyze this information.  It 
[00:06:56] will give you answers and so 
[00:06:58] on.  Lastly, we also improved 
[00:07:04] on the quality and speed in 50 
[00:07:06] different languages.  For 
[00:07:18] ChatGPT and this is very 
[00:07:19] important because we want to be 
[00:07:20] able to bring this experience 
[00:07:21] to as many people out there as 
[00:07:22] possible.  So we are very, very 
[00:07:23] excited to bring GPT-4o to all 
[00:07:24] of our free users out there and 
[00:07:26] for the paid users, they will 
[00:07:26] continue to have up to five 
[00:07:28] times the capacity limits of 
[00:07:30] our free users.  But GPT-4o is 
[00:07:42] not only available in ChatGPT.  
[00:07:44] We also bringing you to the 
[00:07:44] API.  [APPLAUSE] 
[00:07:48] So our developers can start 
[00:07:49] building today with GPT-4o and 
[00:07:55] making amazing AI applications 
[00:07:56] deploying them at scale.  4o is 
[00:08:02] faster, 50% cheaper and five 
[00:08:03] times higher rate limits to 
[00:08:07] GPT-4 Turbo.  As we bring these 
[00:08:10] technologies into the world, it 
[00:08:14] is quite challenging to figure 
[00:08:15] out how to do so in a way that 
[00:08:16] is both useful and also safe.  
[00:08:26] GPT-4o present new challenges 
[00:08:27] for us when it comes to safety 
[00:08:28] because we are dealing with 
[00:08:28] real time audio, real-time 
[00:08:33] vision and our team has been 
[00:08:33] hard at work figuring out how 
[00:08:35] to build in mitigations against 
[00:08:45] misuse.  We continue to work 
[00:08:45] with different stakeholders out 
[00:08:46] there from government, media, 
[00:08:47] entertainment, all industries, 
[00:08:48] civil societies to figure out 
[00:08:52] how to best bring this 
[00:08:53] technologies into the world.  
[00:08:54] Over the next few weeks, we 
[00:08:55] will continue our deployment to 
[00:08:59] bring out all of the 
[00:09:00] capabilities to you.  But 
[00:09:01] today, I want to show you all 
[00:09:07] of these capabilities.  We will 
[00:09:08] do some live demos.  I will 
[00:09:09] bring on two of our research 
[00:09:13] leads Mark Chen and Barrett 
[00:09:14] Zoph.  [APPLAUSE] 
[00:09:24] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Hi I'm 
[00:09:29] Barrett.
[00:09:30] >> MARK CHEN: Hi a mark.  One 
[00:09:30] of the key capabilities we are 
[00:09:31] excited to share his real-time 
[00:09:32] conversational speech.  Will 
[00:09:33] get in Florida.  I am taking 
[00:09:35] out a phone if you're wondering 
[00:09:36] about this wire we have 
[00:09:44] consistent Internet.  If you 
[00:09:45] see there's this little icon on 
[00:09:45] the bottom right of the ChatGPT 
[00:09:46] out.  It will open GPT-4o audio 
[00:09:48] capabilities.  Hey, ChatGPT hi 
[00:09:51] Mark how are you?  
[00:09:52] >> CHAT GPT: Hello Mark I am 
[00:09:57] doing great thanks for asking.  
[00:09:58] How about you?  
[00:09:58] >> MARK CHEN: I am on stage 
[00:10:01] right now and I'm doing a live 
[00:10:02] demo and I am a little bit 
[00:10:10] nervous.  Can you help me, 
[00:10:11] nerves a little bit?  
[00:10:11] >> CHAT GPT: You're doing a 
[00:10:12] live demo right now?  That is 
[00:10:13] awesome.  Just take a deep 
[00:10:19] breath and remember you are the 
[00:10:20] expert here.
[00:10:21] >> MARK CHEN: I like the 
[00:10:21] suggestion let me try a couple 
[00:10:22] of deep breaths.  Can you give 
[00:10:23] me feedback on my breath?  Here 
[00:10:24] I go.  
[00:10:24] >> CHAT GPT: Wold slow down.  
[00:10:29] Mark, you are not a vacuum 
[00:10:29] cleaner.  
[00:10:36] >> MARK CHEN: Let me try again. 
[00:10:37] I am going to breathe in deeply 
[00:10:39] and breathe out.  
[00:10:41] >> CHAT GPT: Exhale slowly.  
[00:10:45] >> MARK CHEN: I will try again. 
[00:10:48] Breathing in and breathe out.  
[00:10:53] >> CHAT GPT: That is it.  How 
[00:10:54] do you feel?  
[00:10:54] >> MARK CHEN: I feel a lot 
[00:10:55] better, thank you so much.  
[00:11:07] >> MIRA MURATI: Mark, you have 
[00:11:08] been working on these 
[00:11:09] capabilities for a while can 
[00:11:10] you tell us how it is different 
[00:11:11] from voice mode?  
[00:11:11] >> MARK CHEN: If you use the 
[00:11:12] voice mode express before you 
[00:11:13] will notice a couple of key 
[00:11:14] differences.  First you cannot 
[00:11:15] interrupt the model you do not 
[00:11:16] have to wait to you finish your 
[00:11:16] term before you can start 
[00:11:17] speaking.  You could but in 
[00:11:18] whenever you want.  Second, the 
[00:11:25] model is real-time 
[00:11:26] responsiveness.  That means 
[00:11:26] that you do not have this 
[00:11:27] awkward two Ãthree second lag 
[00:11:28] before you waitwait for the 
[00:11:39] model to get a response.  
[00:11:41] Finally the model picks up on a 
[00:11:42] motion.  When I was breathing 
[00:11:42] super hard, you can tell.  Hey, 
[00:11:43] you may want to calm down a 
[00:11:44] little bit.  You are running a 
[00:11:45] little bit too fast.  It really 
[00:11:46] has that capability across the 
[00:11:47] board to procedure emotion.  
[00:11:48] Not only that the model is able 
[00:11:48] to generate voice in a variety 
[00:11:51] of different styles.  It really 
[00:11:52] has a wide dynamic range.  I 
[00:11:53] want to fire another demo.  
[00:11:57] Hey, ChatGPT how are you doing? 
[00:12:01] >> CHAT GPT: Am doing 
[00:12:01] fantastic, thanks for asking.  
[00:12:02] How about you?  
[00:12:02] >> MARK CHEN: My friend Barrett 
[00:12:10] he has been having problems 
[00:12:11] sleeping lately.  I want you to 
[00:12:12] tell them a bedtime story about 
[00:12:13] robots in love.  
[00:12:18] >> CHAT GPT: A bedtime story 
[00:12:18] about robots and love?  I got 
[00:12:19] you covered.  Gather around 
[00:12:20] Barrett.  Once upon a time in 
[00:12:21] the world not too different 
[00:12:22] from ours there was a robot 
[00:12:34] named bite.  Bite was a curious 
[00:12:34] robot always exploring -- 
[00:12:35] >> MARK CHEN: I want a little 
[00:12:36] bit emotion in your voice a 
[00:12:37] little bit more drama.
[00:12:37] >> CHAT GPT: Got it.  Let's add 
[00:12:38] some drama.  Once upon a time 
[00:12:39] in a world not too different 
[00:12:40] from ours there was a robot 
[00:12:41] named bite.>> MARK CHEN: I 
[00:12:42] want maximum expression.  
[00:12:52] >> CHAT GPT: That's amplified 
[00:12:53] the drama.  Once upon a time in 
[00:12:54] a world not too different from 
[00:12:55] ours there was a robot named 
[00:12:56] bite.  
[00:12:57] >> MIRA MURATI: Can you do this 
[00:13:01] in a robotic voice now?  
[00:13:01] >> CHAT GPT: Initiating 
[00:13:08] dramatic robotic voice.  Once 
[00:13:08] upon a time in a world not too 
[00:13:09] different from ours there was a 
[00:13:16] robot named bite.  Bite was a 
[00:13:16] curious robot.  Always 
[00:13:17] exploring -- 
[00:13:17] >> MARK CHEN: Can you do the 
[00:13:21] story and a singing voice?  
[00:13:24] >> CHAT GPT: And so bite found 
[00:13:27] another robot friend and they 
[00:13:29] lived circularly ever after.  
[00:13:39] >> MARK CHEN: I definitely feel 
[00:13:40] a lot more relaxed.  [APPLAUSE] 
[00:13:42] >> MIRA MURATI: You have just 
[00:13:47] seen the voice capabilities but 
[00:13:47] we also want to show you 
[00:13:48] division capabilities as the 
[00:13:50] model can also see the world 
[00:13:51] around us.  
[00:13:53] >> BARRETT ZOPH: You can chat 
[00:13:54] with ChatGPT and you can 
[00:13:58] interact with it as well.  Let 
[00:14:02] me boot up ChatGPT.  Hey, 
[00:14:06] ChatGPT.
[00:14:07] >> CHAT GPT: Hello there how's 
[00:14:08] it going?  
[00:14:13] >> BARRETT ZOPH: It's going 
[00:14:13] really well and I would like 
[00:14:14] your help solving a math 
[00:14:15] problem.  
[00:14:15] >> CHAT GPT: What math problem 
[00:14:20] can help you tackle today?  
[00:14:21] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Am going to 
[00:14:22] write down a linear equation on 
[00:14:23] a sheet of paper and I will 
[00:14:24] love help working through it.  
[00:14:26] Don't tell me the solution does 
[00:14:27] give me hints along the way.  
[00:14:28] >> CHAT GPT: Got it.  Okay, I 
[00:14:29] see it.  
[00:14:32] >> BARRETT ZOPH: I did not show 
[00:14:33] you yet.  One second.  
[00:14:38] >> CHAT GPT: I got to excited.  
[00:14:39] I am ready when you are.  
[00:14:48] >> BARRETT ZOPH: ChatGPT what 
[00:14:52] equation did not write down?  
[00:14:53] >> CHAT GPT: I see it now.  You 
[00:14:56] wrote down 3X +1 equals four.  
[00:15:03] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Exactly.  What 
[00:15:04] is the first step to solve 
[00:15:05] this?  
[00:15:05] >> CHAT GPT: The first step is 
[00:15:07] to get all of the terms with X 
[00:15:15] on one side and the constants 
[00:15:16] on the other side.  So what do 
[00:15:17] you think we should do with 
[00:15:18] that +1?  
[00:15:18] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Am going to 
[00:15:19] try to submitsubtract one from 
[00:15:20] both sides and see what I get.
[00:15:23] >> CHAT GPT: Great idea.  
[00:15:24] Perfect.  Now what do you get 
[00:15:25] when you subtract one from both 
[00:15:26] sides?  
[00:15:31] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Okay so 
[00:15:32] ChatGPT this is what I ended up 
[00:15:33] with.  How does this look?  
[00:15:35] >> CHAT GPT: Spot on.  Now you 
[00:15:46] have isolated the term with X 
[00:15:47] on one side and it looks like 
[00:15:48] 3X equals three.  What do you 
[00:15:49] think we should do next to 
[00:15:49] solve for X?  
[00:15:50] >> BARRETT ZOPH: I'm not sure 
[00:15:50] can you give me another hint?  
[00:15:52] >> CHAT GPT: Of course.  You 
[00:15:55] have 3X and you want to find 
[00:15:55] the value of X. Think about 
[00:15:56] what operation with undue 
[00:15:58] multiplication?  
[00:16:03] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Is it 
[00:16:04] subtraction?  
[00:16:04] >> CHAT GPT: Close but think 
[00:16:05] about the opposite of 
[00:16:06] multiplication because 3X 
[00:16:06] equals three times X. 
[00:16:10] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Okay I think 
[00:16:11] it is division.  Let me try to 
[00:16:11] divide both sides by three and 
[00:16:13] see what I get.  
[00:16:13] >> CHAT GPT: Bingo.  Go and 
[00:16:14] head and divide both sides by 
[00:16:14] three.  
[00:16:22] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Okay so 
[00:16:23] ChatGPT this is what I ended up 
[00:16:24] with.  How does this look?  
[00:16:25] >> CHAT GPT: Looks perfect.  
[00:16:26] You have solved it.  X equals 
[00:16:32] one.  Nicely done.  How do you 
[00:16:33] feel about solving linear 
[00:16:34] equations now?  
[00:16:35] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Honestly, -- 
[00:16:51] >> MARK CHEN: Am not confident 
[00:16:52] that I can solve new equations. 
[00:16:53] Why would you need this in the 
[00:16:53] real world?  
[00:16:54] >> CHAT GPT: That is of her 
[00:16:55] questions.  Linear equations 
[00:16:56] pop up in a lot of everyday 
[00:16:56] situations.  Even if we do not 
[00:16:57] realize it.  For example 
[00:16:58] calculating expenses, planning 
[00:16:59] travel, cooking, and even in 
[00:17:00] business for profit and loss 
[00:17:01] calculations.  It is a way to 
[00:17:02] solve problems but you need to 
[00:17:03] find an unknown value.  
[00:17:04] >> MARK CHEN: Have a lot of 
[00:17:05] unknown values in my life.  I'm 
[00:17:06] totally convinced that I'm 
[00:17:08] going to learn math now.  
[00:17:08] [LAUGHTER] 
[00:17:14] >> CHAT GPT: I love the 
[00:17:15] attitude.  Math can help solve 
[00:17:16] some of life ministries.  
[00:17:19] Whenever you to die the more 
[00:17:20] math I am here for you.  
[00:17:21] Anything else you like to 
[00:17:22] tackle today?  
[00:17:31] >> BARRETT ZOPH: I love that 
[00:17:32] you taught my friend Mark that 
[00:17:33] I would have something I would 
[00:17:34] like you to take a look at.  
[00:17:35] >> CHAT GPT: I would love to 
[00:17:35] see what you wrote.  Show it to 
[00:17:36] me whenever you're ready.  
[00:17:37] >> BARRETT ZOPH: This is what I 
[00:17:38] wrote down what do you see?  
[00:17:39] >> CHAT GPT: I see I love 
[00:17:40] ChatGPT.  That is so sweet of 
[00:17:41] you.  
[00:17:45] >> BARRETT ZOPH: I really 
[00:17:46] appreciate all the help.  
[00:17:47] [APPLAUSE] 
[00:17:53] >> CHAT GPT: That is quite 
[00:17:54] outfit you have on.  
[00:17:56] >> BARRETT ZOPH: We can chat in 
[00:17:57] real-time with ChatGPT.  We can 
[00:18:00] interact with video as well.  
[00:18:02] >> MARK CHEN: If you look at 
[00:18:06] Barrett's it's all equations 
[00:18:07] like this.  [LAUGHTER] 
[00:18:12] >> MIRA MURATI: Now that you 
[00:18:12] know you can do linear 
[00:18:13] equations can you show us 
[00:18:14] something more complex?  
[00:18:25] >> MARK CHEN: Let me take a 
[00:18:26] computer out for this.  I am 
[00:18:26] want to open the ChatGPT app.  
[00:18:36] And to get background on what 
[00:18:37] is going on so here we have a 
[00:18:37] computer on the screen we have 
[00:18:38] some cold.  And then the 
[00:18:39] ChatGPT is on this side.  It 
[00:18:43] can hear me but can't see 
[00:18:43] anything on the screen.  I'm 
[00:18:44] going to highlight the code and 
[00:18:47] I will send it to ChatGPT.  I'm 
[00:18:48] going to talk about the code.  
[00:18:51] Hey, ChatGPT.
[00:18:54] >> CHAT GPT: Hey, there how's 
[00:18:55] it going?  Of course I would 
[00:19:08] love to help you.  What is the 
[00:19:09] coding problem you're dealing 
[00:19:10] with?  
[00:19:10] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Am going to 
[00:19:11] share with you some code.  One 
[00:19:11] second.  
[00:19:12] >> CHAT GPT: Sure thing, take 
[00:19:13] your time.  
[00:19:13] >> BARRETT ZOPH: I just shared 
[00:19:14] code with you.  Can you give me 
[00:19:17] a one sentence description of 
[00:19:18] what is going on in the code?  
[00:19:19] >> CHAT GPT: Infectious daily 
[00:19:20] weather for specific location 
[00:19:32] for time period for data using 
[00:19:33] a rolling average and annotates 
[00:19:34] a significant weather event on 
[00:19:35] the resulting plot and displays 
[00:19:36] the plot with the average 
[00:19:37] minimum and maximum 
[00:19:37] temperatures over the year.  
[00:19:38] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Awesome, 
[00:19:39] thanks so much.  In the code 
[00:19:40] there's this function Fu.  Can 
[00:19:41] you thiscan you tell me what it 
[00:19:43] would be if I did not have this 
[00:19:44] function?  
[00:19:45] >> CHAT GPT: The function Fu 
[00:19:46] takes a data frame X taking 
[00:19:59] temperature data and a window 
[00:20:00] sized Y for calculating the 
[00:20:01] rolling name.  It is smooths 
[00:20:02] the average temperature, 
[00:20:03] minimum temperature and maximum 
[00:20:04] temperature columns by applying 
[00:20:06] a rolling mean over the 
[00:20:06] specified window.  With the Fu 
[00:20:07] function the plot which showed 
[00:20:08] smoother temperature lines 
[00:20:09] because the rolling mean 
[00:20:11] reduces the noise or 
[00:20:11] fluctuations in the data.  
[00:20:14] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Awesome, 
[00:20:15] thanks much.  I will want to 
[00:20:16] apply this function.  I am 
[00:20:18] going to generate the plot and 
[00:20:19] show it to you.  Give me one 
[00:20:20] second.  
[00:20:24] >> CHAT GPT: Absolutely.  Take 
[00:20:25] your time.  I'm excited to see 
[00:20:25] the plot when you're ready.  
[00:20:26] >> BARRETT ZOPH: So far ChatGPT 
[00:20:31] have been able to see the cold 
[00:20:32] and now and go to run it and 
[00:20:33] use the vision capabilities of 
[00:20:33] the ChatGPT app so it can see 
[00:20:35] everything going on in the 
[00:20:36] screen as well.  Okay ChatGPT I 
[00:20:47] am sharing with you the plot 
[00:20:48] now.  I'm wondering if you give 
[00:20:49] me a brief one sentence 
[00:20:49] overview of what you see.  
[00:20:54] >> CHAT GPT: Plot displays 
[00:20:55] smooth average minimum and 
[00:20:55] maximum temperatures throughout 
[00:20:57] 2018 with a notable annotation 
[00:20:59] marking a big rainfall event in 
[00:21:00] late September.  
[00:21:01] >> BARRETT ZOPH: -- 
[00:21:05] >> MARK CHEN: What months do 
[00:21:06] you see the hot temperatures?  
[00:21:10] >> CHAT GPT: The hottest 
[00:21:11] temperatures occur around July 
[00:21:11] and August.  The maximum 
[00:21:14] temperature during these months 
[00:21:17] is roughly between 25B0 and 30B 
[00:21:20] 77B0 Fahrenheit Ã86B0F.  
[00:21:36] >> MIRA MURATI: What is going 
[00:21:37] on with the Y axis is this in 
[00:21:38] Celsius to Fahrenheit?  
[00:21:38] >> CHAT GPT: The Y axis is in 
[00:21:39] Celsius.  The temperatures are 
[00:21:40] labeled accordingly such as 
[00:21:41] average temperature, minimum 
[00:21:43] temperature and maximum 
[00:21:43] temperature.  
[00:21:44] >> MARK CHEN: -- 
[00:21:44] >> BARRETT ZOPH: It can help 
[00:21:47] interact with code and see the 
[00:21:53] outputs of plots and everything 
[00:21:54] that is going on on the 
[00:21:55] computer.  [APPLAUSE] 
[00:22:06] >> MIRA MURATI: A few minutes 
[00:22:07] ago we asked a live audience on 
[00:22:08] asked to submit a request for 
[00:22:09] what they would like us to try 
[00:22:10] out.  I will take a couple of 
[00:22:11] prompts.  They want to know if 
[00:22:18] GPT-4o is capable of real-time 
[00:22:20] translation?  Mark do you want 
[00:22:21] to try this one?  
[00:22:24] >> MARK CHEN: Sure, let's do 
[00:22:25] it.  Hey, ChatGPT how are you?  
[00:22:41] >> CHAT GPT: I am doing 
[00:22:42] fantastic.  Thanks for asking.  
[00:22:42] How are you are your day going? 
[00:22:44] >> MARK CHEN: I would like you 
[00:22:44] to function as a translator.  
[00:22:45] Have a friend that only speaks 
[00:22:47] Italian and I only speak 
[00:22:47] English.  Every time you hear 
[00:22:49] English I want you to translate 
[00:22:50] it to its value.  If you hear 
[00:22:51] Italian I want you to translate 
[00:22:52] it back to English.
[00:22:52] >> CHAT GPT: Perfect.  
[00:22:55] >> MIRA MURATI: [speaking In 
[00:23:01] Italian ] 
[00:23:04] >> CHAT GPT: If Wells can talk 
[00:23:05] what would they tell us?  
[00:23:08] >> MARK CHEN: They may ask how 
[00:23:09] do we solve linear equations?  
[00:23:10] >> CHAT GPT: [speaking In 
[00:23:15] Italian] 
[00:23:16] >> MIRA MURATI: [speaking In 
[00:23:21] Italian] 
[00:23:21] >> CHAT GPT: Certainly, yes.  
[00:23:24] >> MARK CHEN: Great, it looks 
[00:23:25] like it works.  [APPLAUSE] 
[00:23:30] >> MIRA MURATI: The next one is 
[00:23:31] from John who asked can you 
[00:23:37] tell what you're feeling just 
[00:23:38] by looking at your face?  
[00:23:42] Barrett do you want to give 
[00:23:42] this one a try?  
[00:23:43] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Absolutely 
[00:23:44] let's give it a try.  Hey, 
[00:23:57] ChatGPT.  
[00:23:58] >> CHAT GPT: Hey, there what is 
[00:23:58] up?  How can I bring your day 
[00:23:59] today?  
[00:23:59] >> BARRETT ZOPH: I'm going to 
[00:24:00] show you a selfie of what I 
[00:24:01] look like and then I would like 
[00:24:02] you to try to see what emotions 
[00:24:03] I am feeling based on how I'm 
[00:24:04] looking.  
[00:24:04] >> CHAT GPT: Sounds like a fun 
[00:24:05] challenge.  Go ahead and show 
[00:24:06] me the selfie and I will put my 
[00:24:07] emotional detective hat on.  
[00:24:08] >> BARRETT ZOPH: Okay so here 
[00:24:09] is me.  What kind of emotions 
[00:24:10] am I doing?  
[00:24:13] >> CHAT GPT: It seems like I am 
[00:24:14] looking at a picture of a 
[00:24:15] wooden surface.  
[00:24:19] >> BARRETT ZOPH: That was the 
[00:24:19] thing I sent you before I'm not 
[00:24:20] actually a table.  Take another 
[00:24:21] look.  
[00:24:22] >> CHAT GPT: That makes more 
[00:24:22] sense.  There we go.  It looks 
[00:24:27] like you're feeling pretty 
[00:24:28] happy and cheerful.  With a big 
[00:24:32] smile and maybe a touch of 
[00:24:33] excitement.  Whatever is going 
[00:24:36] on, it seems like you are in a 
[00:24:36] great mood.  Care to share the 
[00:24:45] source of the device?  
[00:24:46] >> BARRETT ZOPH: The reason I'm 
[00:24:47] in a good mood is we are doing 
[00:24:48] a presentation showcasing how 
[00:24:49] useful and amazing you are.  
[00:24:50] >> CHAT GPT: Oh stop it, you're 
[00:24:51] making me blush.  It.[LAUGHTER] 
[00:24:52] [APPLAUSE] 
[00:24:57] >> MIRA MURATI: Amazing.  That 
[00:24:58] is it for today on live demos.  
[00:24:59] As you can see this feels so 
[00:25:02] magical.  It is wonderful but 
[00:25:03] we also want to remove some of 
[00:25:07] the mysticism from the 
[00:25:07] technology and bring it to you 
[00:25:08] so you can try it for yourself. 
[00:25:13] Over the next few weeks, we 
[00:25:14] will be rolling out these 
[00:25:14] capabilities to everyone.  
[00:25:15] Today has been very much 
[00:25:16] focused on the free users and 
[00:25:19] the new modalities and new 
[00:25:20] products.  But we also care a 
[00:25:22] lot about the next frontier.  
[00:25:27] So soon we will be updating you 
[00:25:28] on our progress towards the 
[00:25:29] next big thing.  And before we 
[00:25:32] wrap up, I just want to thank 
[00:25:32] the incredible OpenAI team and 
[00:25:38] thanks to Janssen and Nvidia 
[00:25:39] team for bringing us the 
[00:25:41] advanced GPU to make this demo 
[00:25:42] possible today.  And thank you 
[00:25:46] all very, very much for being a 
[00:25:47] part of this today.  [APPLAUSE]
