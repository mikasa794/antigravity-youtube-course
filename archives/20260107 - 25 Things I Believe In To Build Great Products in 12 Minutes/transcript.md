[00:00:00] Hey everyone, I've spent over a decade
[00:00:02] as a product leader at companies like
[00:00:04] Meta, Amazon, Reddit, and Roblox. Here
[00:00:08] are 25 things that I believe in to build
[00:00:10] great products. And the funny thing is
[00:00:12] that what I believe in is often the
[00:00:14] opposite of how big companies like to
[00:00:16] work. All right, let's get started.
[00:00:18] First, speed is the only moat. Number
[00:00:21] one, build rapid feedback loops. The
[00:00:24] faster you iterate with real users, the
[00:00:26] better your product will likely be. You
[00:00:28] should be able to build a prototype in
[00:00:30] the morning and get user feedback by
[00:00:32] lunch. You should absolutely reject
[00:00:34] doing three rounds of internal reviews
[00:00:36] before talking to a real user. Number
[00:00:39] two, ship to concentric circles. You
[00:00:41] know, it's almost always a bad idea to
[00:00:43] ship a new product to all your users at
[00:00:46] once. Instead, run staff alphas and
[00:00:49] customer betas to catch issues and
[00:00:52] uplevel quality before launch. I don't
[00:00:54] actually know how to build great
[00:00:55] products without a community of beta
[00:00:58] users who can talk to every day to get
[00:01:00] feedback. Number three, small teams ship
[00:01:03] faster. A team of four to six full stack
[00:01:06] builders who are empowered to co-create
[00:01:08] with users and learn from failure will
[00:01:10] out execute a 50 person org any day of
[00:01:13] the week. The key word here is
[00:01:15] empowered. If you hire a team of A
[00:01:17] players, you have to give them the
[00:01:18] autonomy to iterate relentlessly with
[00:01:21] real users. Number four, iterate with AI
[00:01:24] first. Everyone now has an AI teammate
[00:01:27] who is available 24/7. So work with AI
[00:01:30] to summarize feedback, draft plans, and
[00:01:32] improve your prototypes before you meet
[00:01:35] with your team. Doing the basic AI work
[00:01:37] ahead of time is a baseline expectation
[00:01:40] at this point. And number five, become
[00:01:42] the user. I can't believe I have to say
[00:01:44] this, but you have to dog food your own
[00:01:46] product constantly. Use your product
[00:01:49] like a first-time user and write a
[00:01:51] friction log of how annoying the
[00:01:53] experience is. I estimate that less than
[00:01:56] 10% of PMs actually dog food their own
[00:01:58] product on a weekly basis. You know,
[00:02:01] nobody is too senior to test their own
[00:02:04]  Okay, so to bring these five
[00:02:06] principles to life, I want to share a
[00:02:07] quick example. Boris is the creator of
[00:02:10] clock code and he recently asked for
[00:02:12] user feedback on X and got hundreds of
[00:02:15] replies. And the most remarkable thing
[00:02:17] was he not only responded to each of his
[00:02:19] replies, but he also worked with the AI
[00:02:21] to ship dozens of fixes on the same day.
[00:02:24] Boris is a perfect example of a small
[00:02:26] team of one person in this case
[00:02:28] iterating fast with real users. Speed is
[00:02:31] everything. Okay, the next section is
[00:02:34] focus is a superpower. And let's keep
[00:02:37] going on the list. So number six, do
[00:02:40] fewer things better. I don't believe in
[00:02:42] pursuing more than one to three P 0 high
[00:02:45] priority projects per quarter. Focus on
[00:02:48] solving the biggest user pain points
[00:02:50] that grow your business instead of
[00:02:52] trying to build everything at once. You
[00:02:54] know, saying we can do both or listing
[00:02:56] five to 10 priorities for your team or
[00:02:58] even company is a red flag to me. Number
[00:03:01] seven, do the simple thing first. Always
[00:03:03] ship the simplest thing that could work
[00:03:06] to avoid solving problems that don't
[00:03:08] exist yet. For example, you probably
[00:03:11] shouldn't be optimizing for scaling your
[00:03:13] product if it hasn't even reached
[00:03:15] product market fit yet. Right? So,
[00:03:17] speaking of which, number eight,
[00:03:19] validate your riskiest assumptions
[00:03:21] first. Every product has a few
[00:03:23] assumptions that if wrong will kill the
[00:03:25] whole thing. So, validate these
[00:03:27] assumptions first with real users using
[00:03:30] a simple prototype or AB test before you
[00:03:33] build anything else. Don't work on
[00:03:35] secondary or peripheral features when
[00:03:37] your core hypothesis remains unproven.
[00:03:40] Number nine, protect your calendar. You
[00:03:43] can't build good products and you can't
[00:03:45] focus if you don't have control over
[00:03:47] your time and energy. I like to do deep
[00:03:49] work in the mornings when I have mental
[00:03:51] clarity and I'm ruthless about declining
[00:03:54] meetings that drain my energy. Number
[00:03:56] 10, say no 10 times more than you say
[00:03:59] yes. Get comfortable saying no to
[00:04:01] features, to meetings, and even user
[00:04:03] requests that don't align with the most
[00:04:06] important problems that you want to
[00:04:07] solve. Just be sure to show empathy and
[00:04:10] explain your rationale clearly. The
[00:04:12] other party will usually understand if
[00:04:14] you do this. Okay, so as an example, I
[00:04:17] once worked at a company where the CPO
[00:04:19] announced nine priorities for the year.
[00:04:22] He even had a great acronym to help
[00:04:24] people remember all of these nine
[00:04:26] priorities. After barely making progress
[00:04:28] on any priority for a year, he reduced
[00:04:30] the list to just three. Here's a quote
[00:04:32] from Richard Rumount, who is a
[00:04:34] professional of strategy on what good
[00:04:36] strategy is actually about. At the core,
[00:04:39] strategy is about focus. And most
[00:04:41] complex organizations don't focus their
[00:04:44] resources. Instead, they pursue multiple
[00:04:46] goals at once, not concentrating enough
[00:04:48] resources to achieve a breakthrough in
[00:04:51] any of them. So, focus your priorities,
[00:04:53] focus your time. Focus is the key to
[00:04:56] achieve a breakthrough product. All
[00:04:58] right, moving on. The next section is
[00:05:00] product over process. And let's start
[00:05:02] with number 11, which is reject PM
[00:05:05] theater. You know, I've talked about how
[00:05:07] important it is to build feedback loops
[00:05:09] with real users, but most PMs are
[00:05:11] focused on internal theater like
[00:05:13] polishing documents and doing endless
[00:05:16] pre meetings before the actual review.
[00:05:18] You have to obsess about the product the
[00:05:21] users actually use, not about your
[00:05:24] internal artifacts. I know it's hard,
[00:05:26] but try your best to do this. Number 12,
[00:05:28] build minimum viable plans. You know,
[00:05:31] stop pretending that you know exactly
[00:05:33] what to build a year from now. Instead,
[00:05:35] create a minimal viable plan that covers
[00:05:38] the user problem, vision, goals,
[00:05:41] principles, solution, and what you're
[00:05:43] not doing. Keep it to one page and
[00:05:46] update it as you learn. reject annual
[00:05:48] planning and OKR theater. Number 12,
[00:05:51] practice prototype verse development.
[00:05:53] You know, prototypes give people a much
[00:05:55] better sense of your solution than any
[00:05:57] slide deck or document. They're also
[00:05:59] more fun to build and easier to test
[00:06:01] with real users. You can use tools like
[00:06:04] Google AI Studio, Replet, Cursor, all
[00:06:06] these different tools to build a
[00:06:08] prototype of your product first and most
[00:06:10] importantly, show it to stakeholders and
[00:06:12] real users for feedback. So validate
[00:06:15] interest with a prototype before you
[00:06:18] create your PRDN design to cover a bunch
[00:06:20] of the edge cases. All right, speaking
[00:06:22] of edge cases, number 14 is obsess about
[00:06:25] the details, default states, edge cases,
[00:06:27] and writing good copy. These details are
[00:06:30] what separates a great product from
[00:06:32] slop. It doesn't matter how senior you
[00:06:34] are. You have to give a damn about the
[00:06:36] tiniest details to ship something that
[00:06:38] you can be proud of. Number 15, simplify
[00:06:41] product reviews. You know, nothing slows
[00:06:43] down velocity like waiting weeks to get
[00:06:45] on an executive's calendar to review
[00:06:47] your work before you can ship. So, if
[00:06:49] you're a leader or exec, empower your
[00:06:51] team to ship freely to their beta
[00:06:53] community and review prototypes async
[00:06:56] instead of blocking them around your
[00:06:57] busy schedule. As an example, RAMP grew
[00:07:00] to $32 billion in record time by
[00:07:03] empowering their team to ship fast. As
[00:07:06] Jeff Ramp's CPO explains in this post,
[00:07:09] RAM teams can ship to beta users at any
[00:07:12] time without an exact permission. And
[00:07:14] they also have a minimal review process
[00:07:16] before they can ship to general
[00:07:17] availability. The line that I
[00:07:19] particularly love in this tweet is
[00:07:21] leadership has 48 hours to review the
[00:07:24] product or it just ships. This puts
[00:07:27] accountability on the leaders and the
[00:07:28] execs not to slow down product velocity.
[00:07:32] Next section is really important. You
[00:07:34] have to be ruthlessly truth seeeking.
[00:07:37] Number 16. You know, arrogance is the
[00:07:39] biggest turnoff. I cannot stand product
[00:07:41] leaders and creators who think they're
[00:07:43] better than everyone else. The best
[00:07:45] leaders that I've met are also the most
[00:07:46] humble because they failed repeatedly
[00:07:49] before and they've seen some real
[00:07:51] If you're not humble, then you're not
[00:07:53] listening and you won't build great
[00:07:55] products. Number 17, ban decision by
[00:07:58] committee. I don't believe in uh cross
[00:08:00] functional alignment as a goal because
[00:08:02] trying to make all stakeholders happy
[00:08:04] will inevitably compromise the product
[00:08:07] experience. So definitely seek diverse
[00:08:09] opinions from the stakeholders and real
[00:08:11] customers but then have a single person
[00:08:14] make the call and own the outcome. Don't
[00:08:16] try to do decision by committee. It
[00:08:18] never works. Number 18. Don't surround
[00:08:20] yourself with single fence. Great
[00:08:22] companies decay when leaders surround
[00:08:24] themselves with yesmen who won't
[00:08:26] challenge their ideas. Find and reward
[00:08:29] people for willing to ask the hard
[00:08:30] questions as long as they stay
[00:08:32] constructive. You know, if you have a
[00:08:33] product review and everyone's silent and
[00:08:35] just nodding their heads, that's
[00:08:37] actually a bad sign. You want to
[00:08:38] encourage debate. All right, number 19.
[00:08:40] Assume good intentions. When you
[00:08:42] disagree with someone, listen to
[00:08:44] understand what they're saying instead
[00:08:46] of trying to formulate a rebuttal.
[00:08:48] Chances are they're actually making a
[00:08:49] great point that you haven't considered.
[00:08:51] The best debates are collaborative truth
[00:08:54] seeeking exercises, not battles to be
[00:08:57] run. And number 20, be willing to be
[00:08:59] wrong. Most decisions are reversible
[00:09:02] two-way doors. And the right move is
[00:09:04] often to just decide and learn instead
[00:09:06] of waiting for perfect information. I
[00:09:08] learned this quote from my interview
[00:09:09] with Jana. By the time you've debated
[00:09:12] two ideas, I've already shipped 10.
[00:09:14] Don't wait for perfect information. Just
[00:09:16] launch and be willing to be wrong. So,
[00:09:19] as an example, recently at work, a few
[00:09:21] stakeholders pushed for a feature that I
[00:09:23] resisted for weeks. But I kept talking
[00:09:25] to users and showing them prototypes
[00:09:27] anyway. And eventually the feedback from
[00:09:29] the users and the stakeholders changed
[00:09:31] my mind. And I admitted that I was
[00:09:33] wrong. I showed the evidence why. And
[00:09:35] now we're building something that we're
[00:09:37] more confident about. The point is your
[00:09:39] goal should be to find the truth, not to
[00:09:41] prove that you're right all the time.
[00:09:43] All right, the last section I feel
[00:09:45] especially strongly about and that is
[00:09:47] builders over bureaucrats. Look for
[00:09:50] people who generally care about crafting
[00:09:51] great products instead of people who are
[00:09:53] just doing it to climb the career
[00:09:55] ladder. Also try to hire people who have
[00:09:57] that just figure it out energy. They're
[00:09:58] willing to wear multiple hats and solve
[00:10:01] problems instead of waiting for
[00:10:02] permission. Number 22, proof of work is
[00:10:05] greater than credentials. You know, in
[00:10:07] this day and age, people don't care
[00:10:09] about your fan pedigree or AI product
[00:10:11] certificate. I want to hire people who
[00:10:13] have built great side projects or
[00:10:14] demonstrated high agency in some way,
[00:10:17] shape, or form. The only credential that
[00:10:18] matters is what they've shipped. What
[00:10:20] was the impact that they made and what
[00:10:22] are their ideas to improve your product?
[00:10:25] Number 23, hell yes or no. If you're not
[00:10:28] excited about a candidate, don't hire
[00:10:30] them hoping that they'll work out. One
[00:10:32] great hire beats three mediocre ones.
[00:10:34] And never lower the bar because you're
[00:10:36] desperate to fill a rope. Number 24.
[00:10:39] Your job title doesn't actually really
[00:10:41] matter. The best teams blur the lines
[00:10:43] between PM design and engineering. I
[00:10:45] love it when engineers update my spec
[00:10:47] and when designers let me tweet copy in
[00:10:49] Figma. Build a team of full stack
[00:10:51] builders who trust and respect each
[00:10:54] other's craft. And last but not least,
[00:10:56] aim to replace yourself. Your job as a
[00:10:59] product leader is to eventually make
[00:11:00] yourself unnecessary. If your team can't
[00:11:03] function without you for a week, that's
[00:11:04] actually a failure, not a flex. The best
[00:11:07] leaders empower others so that they can
[00:11:09] move on to higher order problems. So as
[00:11:12] an example, I'm hiring a senior PM right
[00:11:14] now and I explicitly wrote in the job
[00:11:16] description to link your best side
[00:11:18] project or ship product at the top of
[00:11:20] your application. Now what I really
[00:11:22] dislike is seeing vague jargon or
[00:11:24] buzzwords like agile expert or strategic
[00:11:27] product leader. That stuff is really
[00:11:29] just meaningless to me. Just start with
[00:11:31] what you shipped and what the impact
[00:11:33] was. All right, so there you have it. 25
[00:11:35] things that I believe in to build great
[00:11:37] products after over a decade working at
[00:11:40] some of the best companies. And if you
[00:11:42] like this list, I encourage you to write
[00:11:43] down your own and find and work for
[00:11:45] companies that share the same values and
[00:11:48] principles as yourself. It'll make your
[00:11:50] life much easier. I promise. All right.
