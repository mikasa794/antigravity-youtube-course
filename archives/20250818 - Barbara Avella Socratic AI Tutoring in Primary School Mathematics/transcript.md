[00:00:01] just getting the slides up. Okay, while
[00:00:02] we get that up, I'm introduce our next
[00:00:05] speaker. So, Barbara Abella is a primary
[00:00:07] school teacher uh visiting us from
[00:00:10] Italy. Uh and she's at the Institut
[00:00:15] [Music]
[00:00:19] in Rome, Italy.
[00:00:21] >> Yes. Uh and she is um going to be
[00:00:24] talking about some work that you did in
[00:00:25] your class uh teaching AI, right? So
[00:00:27] it's a small study just preliminary
[00:00:30] results but anyway
[00:00:32] >> okay um I will share with you this
[00:00:35] experience made conducted with my class
[00:00:39] made by uh 18 uh kids uh from different
[00:00:45] um origin they come from Italy but also
[00:00:48] from uh Morocco and Peru and maybe uh
[00:00:52] Mulavia and other countries. Anyway,
[00:00:57] um sorry, this is me. I'm just a
[00:01:02] scientific ambassador uh community for
[00:01:05] scientics for a science teacher in
[00:01:08] Europe. Anyway, uh we we we know that
[00:01:14] for this century the one important u
[00:01:18] sorry
[00:01:20] some uh skills
[00:01:22] the uh for for for kids are um problem
[00:01:28] uh solving and critical thinking. And in
[00:01:31] Europe uh the committee uh the European
[00:01:34] committee um published some uh some
[00:01:39] documents uh directed to this uh this uh
[00:01:44] skills to to obtain these skills and
[00:01:46] then uh we had uh the de comp 2.2 two
[00:01:53] that is the fra framework for for
[00:01:56] digital competences for citizens in
[00:01:59] Europe for this century uh or and QR
[00:02:03] code you can find you can find the
[00:02:05] original documents okay uh but in in
[00:02:08] Italy we faces uh educational
[00:02:11] disparities disparities uh several sever
[00:02:14] disparities and as you can see uh there
[00:02:17] are difference from north and south
[00:02:20] where uh
[00:02:22] uh kids and and not kids, students uh
[00:02:26] that go out from school like uh are
[00:02:30] lacking um competences and so you can
[00:02:34] see in Sandro only 29 are lacking
[00:02:38] competences but in south like in croon
[00:02:42] uh this amount 65% is very high
[00:02:46] competent uh is very it's very important
[00:02:50] and So
[00:02:53] uh the most important is that only 40
[00:02:57] 50% of students are able to solve
[00:03:01] problem uh in
[00:03:04] uh
[00:03:05] of course I said uh
[00:03:09] are able to to uh to solve this problem.
[00:03:12] But you as you can see uh to solve a
[00:03:16] problem is important. You need to
[00:03:20] identify relevant data and interpret
[00:03:22] interpretation the um the word pro the
[00:03:26] words the words of the problem and
[00:03:29] reasoning and choosing appropriate
[00:03:30] operation. And so
[00:03:34] uh I think that I would try how uh
[00:03:38] socratic tutoring could improve the
[00:03:40] skills for these students. And
[00:03:44] uh socratic tutoring is a uh on socratic
[00:03:49] dialogue that uh
[00:03:53] made a reflection made the student
[00:03:55] reflect about the text and what is
[00:03:59] doing. And so I was thinking that uh I
[00:04:04] could stimulate reflection at promoting
[00:04:07] uh uh the uh critical thinking.
[00:04:12] I act I acted as an artisan. So I
[00:04:17] shining technology with pedagogical uh
[00:04:21] care and fuse tradition socratic and AI
[00:04:25] tutoring. Then more understanding all I
[00:04:29] design, calibrate and adapt the uh the
[00:04:34] the activity for my kids.
[00:04:37] Uh and this was the activity. Uh
[00:04:44] I
[00:04:45] I focused on the uh D comp to 2.2 areas
[00:04:51] that is information navigation and
[00:04:53] evaluation and problem solving. just
[00:04:57] three and this is the merable questions.
[00:05:00] So other question so canary tutoring be
[00:05:04] effectively uh a scaffold the the kids
[00:05:08] to
[00:05:10] uh the information leader and uh foster
[00:05:15] can anyway cano AIC tutors foster
[00:05:19] critical uh
[00:05:22] assessment skills and the last one if
[00:05:26] the socratic AI improvement students
[00:05:29] ability to break down and solve
[00:05:31] multi-step problem
[00:05:34] and
[00:05:36] the methodology. Okay. Uh I can see I
[00:05:39] can see okay this is a test and uh with
[00:05:47] uh 18 students as I say before and
[00:05:52] anyway they
[00:05:55] solve the problem but the problem was uh
[00:05:59] exposed as narrative uh history and then
[00:06:04] um I know the limit is the number and
[00:06:08] the mathematical data. Anyway, I would
[00:06:12] try to uh explore this.
[00:06:15] Uh
[00:06:17] I in in Europe we have a problem about
[00:06:20] the pro data protection and so uh I used
[00:06:26] the um AI with my own uh um account not
[00:06:32] kids use the uh use the the and I credit
[00:06:38] question sequences and in real time I
[00:06:42] intervented with a responses
[00:06:45] divergence. Okay.
[00:06:48] first. Okay, this is uh an example uh of
[00:06:55] a problem and I try to uh enhance the uh
[00:07:02] index of reability
[00:07:05] because uh
[00:07:08] you know uh there's a um a difficult to
[00:07:12] uh understand text and uh I think in
[00:07:16] Italy almost uh we touch the the lowest
[00:07:22] uh level and uh maybe
[00:07:26] enhance the uh index uh the kids uh
[00:07:30] maybe pay more attention to the the the
[00:07:34] text. Okay. So I decide to transform the
[00:07:37] text and this is analysis is made by uh
[00:07:41] Voyant to an app that you you we use.
[00:07:45] Okay. Uh these are the three uh most
[00:07:51] important uh questions and uh the the
[00:07:56] first is uh the first line is for
[00:07:59] understand the uh the problem the the
[00:08:01] text in a deep a deep uh understanding
[00:08:07] and then identify the path for the
[00:08:09] solution and at last the calculation if
[00:08:13] applicable anyway it's important And for
[00:08:16] me they understand text and think about
[00:08:20] the uh path to solve the problem no
[00:08:24] more. This is the flow of the work. So
[00:08:28] identify the problem text and then uh
[00:08:31] use the uh use the uh AI to
[00:08:36] to to be able to resolve the uh the
[00:08:39] problem. Okay.
[00:08:42] And this uh this is the the problem and
[00:08:45] for you an inch and
[00:08:49] uh we choose a problem well different
[00:08:52] problem and this is an example and then
[00:08:54] define the promp for the AI tutor and
[00:09:00] this uh they uh
[00:09:04] act in problem based learning and coent
[00:09:07] learning and uh at first individual
[00:09:11] approach And then in a collaboration is
[00:09:13] M group and the text was the the task
[00:09:17] was on narative based and uh
[00:09:22] this is a okay uncle baby's v uh the
[00:09:27] vocabulary was complex and the real word
[00:09:31] was for engage
[00:09:34] and
[00:09:36] this is the analysis
[00:09:38] u pre and post uh assessments to
[00:09:43] understand if was uh a change in the
[00:09:48] ability of the the the kids. And this is
[00:09:51] the the the tab that I use. And now some
[00:09:56] results. As you can see, this is for u
[00:10:00] uh the uh D comp one uh 2.3 and this is
[00:10:07] uh the ability to uh extract uh extract
[00:10:12] uh data or uh understand the the the
[00:10:15] text and uh uh in green I'll uh before
[00:10:20] and yellow as uh is for uh the last uh
[00:10:25] performance.
[00:10:27] And uh I have just one kid that is uh I
[00:10:31] say uh
[00:10:33] uh is not affected by any any kind of
[00:10:38] intervent intervention but uh all the
[00:10:42] the most kids was improving their
[00:10:45] competences
[00:10:47] and uh this is for the uh
[00:10:51] 23
[00:10:54] and
[00:10:57] Uh this is for the last the another one
[00:11:01] uh item and as you can see uh some
[00:11:06] better performance and this is the
[00:11:09] results and information data and theu
[00:11:12] students demonstrate uh improvement
[00:11:15] skills. This was uh u most uh uh evident
[00:11:19] for one kid that is coming from
[00:11:23] Philippine and he's very very very smart
[00:11:26] smart for calculation and logic but uh
[00:11:30] he doesn't understand uh Italian uh well
[00:11:36] anyway we observe that uh he was uh more
[00:11:41] able to to do it uh and uh they was uh
[00:11:48] they reached the better results for the
[00:11:51] end of the school
[00:11:54] and uh this is a a generic regal uh uh
[00:12:00] diagram and uh this is the results for
[00:12:04] students.
[00:12:06] Uh this is the the discussion. Okay. The
[00:12:09] data are few anyway. Uh we uh faces uh
[00:12:18] hard competences for uh
[00:12:22] understand uh language and mathematics.
[00:12:26] And maybe uh this could be interest uh
[00:12:29] uh to could be interesting uh analyze
[00:12:32] better this uh this uh this uh field and
[00:12:37] uh
[00:12:39] uh
[00:12:42] it's
[00:12:45] very uh interesting that uh if you think
[00:12:49] about uh sigma 2 of bloom and vigotsski
[00:12:55] how This uh socratic tutoring by AI
[00:13:00] could be uh scaffold and uh
[00:13:05] uh gently push push uh for understand
[00:13:10] and uh solve problem
[00:13:14] and uh the ability
[00:13:17] is a uh a mix for language, math and
[00:13:21] logic. And uh we have to improve the
[00:13:24] language uh at first uh because uh
[00:13:28] problem solving is impossible if you
[00:13:31] don't understand the language and the
[00:13:34] conclusion is uh can socratically
[00:13:36] tutoring be affecting development. Yes,
[00:13:38] I think so. But we need more evidence
[00:13:42] evident and uh
[00:13:46] it uh foster cral assessment uh skills.
[00:13:51] Yes, but we need to uh test uh it uh
[00:13:55] more and
[00:14:00] they were they show shown uh a better
[00:14:03] results. Sure. for my class this year.
[00:14:06] OB obviously
[00:14:08] uh
[00:14:11] this was a regulation about metag
[00:14:13] metacognitive past autonomy and cross
[00:14:18] disciplinary learning because uh
[00:14:20] sometimes
[00:14:22] uh Italian language teacher are
[00:14:27] far away from math teacher. But if you
[00:14:30] uh I I try to
[00:14:34] uh put in uh match the results for uh
[00:14:39] resumes. How do you say rums?
[00:14:42] When you uh take a text and uh short uh
[00:14:46] short short and problem solving uh often
[00:14:52] the results are uh uh similar very
[00:14:57] similar
[00:14:59] and uh
[00:15:02] is
[00:15:05] we we tested uh uh was
[00:15:09] interest was interesting ing align with
[00:15:12] the D comp 2.2
[00:15:15] 2 indicators and special in 1.1 1.3 and
[00:15:20] 53.3
[00:15:22] that's really uh for uh
[00:15:26] uh data
[00:15:28] uh extract data understand test and uh
[00:15:33] critical thinking and uh this is my
[00:15:37] think uh my story about future direction
[00:15:42] and uh
[00:15:44] I
[00:15:46] maybe en the number of kids could be uh
[00:15:51] useful and this is for reference from
[00:15:54] the study and this
[00:15:58] I'm uh I'm very happy to be here but
[00:16:02] very emotion
[00:16:04] sorry
[00:16:07] anyway
[00:16:09] I would add that on the QR code you can
[00:16:12] find all the
[00:16:16] all the material all the documents such
[00:16:17] as a metacognitive uh tab tab for uh
[00:16:23] that kids can use that kids can use to
[00:16:27] uh trace the the path.
