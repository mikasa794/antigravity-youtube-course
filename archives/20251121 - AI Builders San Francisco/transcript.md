[00:00:02] The tools that you're using today are
[00:00:05] the worst they're ever going to be. This
[00:00:07] is a technology that if you were to ask
[00:00:09] us a few months ago, we would have said
[00:00:11] some aspects were unlikely or
[00:00:13] impossible. And now they're inevitable.
[00:00:15] If you're in this room, you're probably
[00:00:17] doing something right. This is the place
[00:00:19] where it's all happening. Not down in
[00:00:21] the peninsula, not in Palo Alto. It's
[00:00:24] happening all in San Francisco.
[00:00:27] There are 10,000 papers that are
[00:00:29] published every single day. If you're a
[00:00:31] doctor, you're seeing like 3,000
[00:00:32] patients a year. Open evidence makes it
[00:00:34] easy to access the wealth of knowledge
[00:00:36] that we know as a species as a
[00:00:38] practitioner with a specific patient in
[00:00:40] front of you.
[00:00:41] >> What we're trying to do long-term is
[00:00:43] basically transform the way that legal
[00:00:45] services and probably professional
[00:00:47] services are actually delivered.
[00:00:49] >> How is it going to reduce burnout? Is it
[00:00:51] just going to mean people do more work
[00:00:52] or how are you thinking about that? I do
[00:00:54] not think that in 10 years lawyers are
[00:00:55] going to do less work. But if they are
[00:00:58] doing work that they enjoy significantly
[00:01:00] more, they won't be as burned out.
[00:01:02] >> We've had this like amazing viral
[00:01:04] growth. How do you looking back say like
[00:01:07] these were key things that unlocked the
[00:01:09] word of mouth traction?
[00:01:10] >> We just kept iterating very very early
[00:01:12] on. Is this awesome? Is this awesome? Is
[00:01:14] this awesome? Until it actually was
[00:01:15] awesome. Something told us this is the
[00:01:17] best thing for physicians since the
[00:01:19] advent of penicellin.
[00:01:21] >> Everything's going to change, right? And
[00:01:23] because of that kind of like entropy,
[00:01:25] you can get folks to be more on board
[00:01:27] with wild ideas.
[00:01:28] >> You have to to like commit yourself to
[00:01:30] being like this is the most important
[00:01:32] thing and like I we are going to solve
[00:01:34] this and it's going to be incredible and
[00:01:36] change the world.
