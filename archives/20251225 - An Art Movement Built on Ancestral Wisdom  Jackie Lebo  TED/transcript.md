[00:00:04] Where I come from, we greet people:
[00:00:07] How are you?
[00:00:08] How are the children?
[00:00:10] How are the cattle?
[00:00:11] Is it raining?
[00:00:13] So, how are you?
[00:00:15] How are the children?
[00:00:17] How the cattle? Do you have cattle?
[00:00:19] Do you have moose? Meese?
[00:00:20] Mooses? No.
[00:00:22] OK.
[00:00:23] (Laughter)
[00:00:24] Is it raining?
[00:00:25] Though here, I think
you should ask for sun.
[00:00:27] So yeah.
[00:00:29] So I went to Turkana
in 2014 to make a film.
[00:00:33] Turkana is in the northernmost
part of Kenya,
[00:00:36] and the people there
have been marginalized for so long
[00:00:40] that they don't identify as Kenyans.
[00:00:43] Post-independence policies had focused
all the resources of the new country
[00:00:49] in the agriculturally rich south.
[00:00:52] But now, with the discovery of oil,
[00:00:54] Kenya was laying claim to Turkana.
[00:00:57] Just one generation before,
[00:00:59] my family was compelled by the twin forces
[00:01:02] of modernity and colonialism
[00:01:05] to transition away
from a life of nomadic pastoralism.
[00:01:11] My grandfather would still tell stories
[00:01:14] of wandering up and down the Rift Valley
[00:01:16] with their animals
[00:01:17] that seemed so far removed
from the life we lived now.
[00:01:22] And he would be like, "This is you,"
[00:01:24] pointing to pictures of Maasai
people in full traditional regalia.
[00:01:28] And I was like, "No, no, no,
[00:01:30] those are the guys who live
in 'National Geographic.'"
[00:01:32] (Laughter)
[00:01:33] So we went into the project
[00:01:35] believing that people wanted
a fair share of the oil revenues,
[00:01:39] which they did.
[00:01:40] But they wanted so much more.
[00:01:42] They wanted water and security
[00:01:44] to continue with their
pastoralist way of life,
[00:01:47] because it was part
of their culture and identity.
[00:01:51] This forced us to think
of new ways of being in the world
[00:01:54] that we hadn't previously considered.
[00:01:57] I'm going to talk about how
our work in Turkana taught us
[00:02:00] to creatively collaborate,
[00:02:02] and then how that taught us
to come together, share revenues
[00:02:07] and share our humanity.
[00:02:10] Turkana is organized
in units called “Ere,”
[00:02:13] which have rights
to particular grazing points
[00:02:17] and our watering lands.
[00:02:19] And this is more like
a custodianship than an ownership,
[00:02:23] and it has led organizations on the ground
[00:02:26] to think of new sharing models
that were based on the culture,
[00:02:31] rather than copy pasting from economies
that had been doing this for longer.
[00:02:36] So instead of putting all the resources
into our documentary,
[00:02:39] which could be made
by literally three people,
[00:02:42] we decided to make something bigger
that could bring in many more artists.
[00:02:46] So we brought together ten artists,
[00:02:47] five from Nairobi and five from Turkana,
[00:02:50] and embarked on a tour of the county.
[00:02:53] We went to the oil fields in the south
[00:02:56] and danced with an Edong’a 
group in Nakukulas.
[00:03:00] We went to Turkana Basin Institute
[00:03:02] and saw fossils that were
millions of years old.
[00:03:05] We went to Central Island
and visited tilapia,
[00:03:09] crocodile and flamingo lakes.
[00:03:12] We went swimming in Lake Turkana
under a full moon
[00:03:15] that made the lake look like milk.
[00:03:17] We were assured that the crocodiles
stayed on their side
[00:03:20] and the people stayed on their side.
[00:03:22] And anyway, there was the rule of ten.
[00:03:24] If ten of you were swimming,
[00:03:26] there was only a 10 percent chance
you'd be eaten by a crocodile.
[00:03:29] (Laughter)
[00:03:31] We went to a cattle kraal
near the River Turkwel
[00:03:35] and slept on hides on the ground.
[00:03:37] It suddenly made so much sense
to me why we greet the way we do.
[00:03:41] How are you, how are the children,
[00:03:43] how are the cattle, is it raining?
[00:03:46] Those had been the essential elements
of our lives for generations.
[00:03:50] Without cattle, we would not survive.
[00:03:53] Without the rain, the cattle
would not survive.
[00:03:56] Without descendants,
[00:03:57] who'd tell our stories when we were gone?
[00:04:00] I felt a deep connection
with my grandfather.
[00:04:03] In fact,
[00:04:05] we all came out of that journey
profoundly moved.
[00:04:09] Perhaps it was lying down on the sand
and watching the flights to Europe
[00:04:14] and the Middle East pass overhead
[00:04:16] and thinking that this was the same path
our human ancestors took
[00:04:21] tens of thousands of years ago
to populate the Earth.
[00:04:26] Perhaps it was opening up
yourself to the moment
[00:04:30] in the place where we first
evolved connection,
[00:04:33] cooperation, compassion.
[00:04:35] The very things we define as humanity.
[00:04:39] So we started to make work
from that basis.
[00:04:43] And our shared experiences
[00:04:46] plus the new discoveries
[00:04:47] made work that exceeded
our individual capabilities.
[00:04:51] This is from our first project.
[00:04:53] It’s called “The Flyest
Wedding in Africa,”
[00:04:55] and we imagined what
the clothes would look like
[00:04:58] if we took from what we had seen
[00:05:01] rather than, you know,
white dresses and tuxes.
[00:05:05] And this is our second project,
[00:05:07] It’s called “Floating, Flying.”
[00:05:09] We shot it in and around Lake Turkana,
[00:05:12] which is one of our biggest
sources of inspiration.
[00:05:15] And we imagined a muse
who was also a guardian of the lake.
[00:05:20] So what we learned
is that through collaboration,
[00:05:23] we align with higher values.
[00:05:26] The false notion that we can harm others,
[00:05:29] or even our planet,
[00:05:31] without harming ourselves, cannot stand.
[00:05:34] True connectedness
[00:05:35] and participation in something
greater than ourselves
[00:05:38] contribute immensely to happiness,
[00:05:41] self-worth, and reaffirm our humanity.
[00:05:46] This is our third photo series.
[00:05:49] It’s called “Oil + Milk”
and we are the land of milk
[00:05:52] so we were imagining the effects
that oil would have on our way of life.
[00:05:57] And this is our first foray into music.
[00:06:00] You can see Elizabeth
and Eddie Gray right there,
[00:06:03] and we did this during the pandemic,
so we were not expecting much,
[00:06:07] but it has turned out to be
our most beloved
[00:06:10] and successful project to date.
[00:06:13] So with this work under our belt,
[00:06:15] we started to look for an agent
so that we could showcase the work.
[00:06:18] And they were like, "Who's the artist?"
[00:06:20] And we were like, "All of us."
[00:06:21] And they were like, "I can't sell that."
[00:06:24] So we built our own platform,
[00:06:27] the Nomadic Arts Festival,
[00:06:29] to continue this work
[00:06:31] and to continue sharing
with so many more artists
[00:06:34] and bringing in ancient
and contemporary art forms.
[00:06:38] We will close today with two songs
[00:06:41] created for the inaugural
edition of the festival.
[00:06:44] "Eloto" is a young woman's plea
[00:06:46] not to be married off
to a man she doesn't love,
[00:06:49] and “Ateker” is a celebration
of our home region.
[00:06:54] Thank you.
[00:06:55] (Applause and cheers)
[00:07:02] (Electric guitar music)
[00:08:09] (Singing)
[00:09:35] (Singing and music end)
[00:09:39] (Cheers and applause)
[00:09:45] (Electric guitar music)
[00:09:59] (Singing)
[00:13:18] (Music ends)
[00:13:20] (Cheers)
[00:13:23] (Applause)
