[00:00:00] Good afternoon everyone. We are team 1B code 
and chaos. Today we're excited to present our  
[00:00:05] app handtohand created under the theme food 
insecurity. Our app is a solution designed  
[00:00:11] to reduce food waste by empowering high school 
students to take action in meaningful way. I am  
[00:00:18] Hini joined by my team Anushka Catalina 
Gatri and Sanja. Before we dive in,  
[00:00:25] we'd like to give a special thank you to our 
mentor, Kira, um, Cop, Dr. Tanya, Jeff, Juan,  
[00:00:31] and of course, the judges. Okay, now imagine 
that it's 9:30 p.m. on a Thursday night. The  
[00:00:37] kitchen at a restaurant is shutting down. 
Staff throws loads of untouched pasta,  
[00:00:41] fresh bread, and grilled vegetables into 
a trash can. Not because it's spoiled,  
[00:00:46] but just because it wasn't sold. It happens every 
single night. Right around the corner lives Sarah,  
[00:00:53] a single mom. She relies on local food pantries to 
feed her kids. But some days with empty shelves,  
[00:00:59] she leaves knowing her kids will go hungry. 
Sometimes she turns to organizations like Too  
[00:01:06] Good to Start. Too good to go, which sells surplus 
meals at a dis discount for $5.99. She couldn't  
[00:01:13] make it to work, but the nearest location was a 
25-minute walk with no stroller, no car, two kids,  
[00:01:19] and no time after her shift. It was nearly 
impossible. It wasn't that food didn't exist.  
[00:01:25] It was that she had no way to get there. Food 
rescue apps and discounted meals have existed,  
[00:01:30] but none solved the root of Sarah's and other 
famil family's challenges. Transportation. The  
[00:01:36] invisible barrier standing in the way. But what if 
the system didn't rely on Hungary finding a ride,  
[00:01:42] but instead found a way to deliver hope right to 
your door? So, what is the problem? The problem is  
[00:01:49] transportation. the missing link between surplus 
food and the people who need it. Every day,  
[00:01:53] good food is wasted while families like Sarah 
struggle to access meals. Existing programs expect  
[00:01:58] people to travel without reliable transportation. 
And that's the real problem. A system that expects  
[00:02:03] people like Sarah to find the food when what 
they really need is for the food to find them.  
[00:02:08] Food insecurity impacts every part of life. 
Harding people's health, harming the planet,  
[00:02:13] and wasting resources. We interviewed several 
local restaurants and found that good food is  
[00:02:18] thrown out almost daily. When asked what would 
make donating easier, transportation was amongst  
[00:02:24] the popular answers. We also surveyed a group 
of 92 people and many view food waste as a major  
[00:02:31] issue and believe that technology can help solve 
it. This is why our team created the solution  
[00:02:37] hand to hand. Our app consists of three main 
features. Firstly, the scanner allows donors to  
[00:02:42] use the in-app camera to scan food items, which 
helps log expiration dates and quantities. The  
[00:02:48] donor portal lets businesses register through a 
secure portal by uploading their business license,  
[00:02:53] ensuring all food donors are verified, keeping the 
system reliable. And lastly, the map feature shows  
[00:02:59] real-time locations of nearby food donations and 
available pickups. Volunteers can easily see where  
[00:03:04] help is needed and plan the most efficient routes. 
Here's a quick demo of our app. Our app supports  
[00:03:09] login for three different types of users. Here, 
a donor logs in using their credentials. They  
[00:03:14] can enter details about their donation, including 
the item, quantity, production date, pickup time,  
[00:03:19] and even a brief description in the notes section. 
This provides recipients with clear details about  
[00:03:25] the item they'll be receiving, helping them know 
what to expect. We also offer a camera feature  
[00:03:30] that allows donors to upload a picture of the food 
they're donating. They can submit their donation,  
[00:03:35] making it instantly visible to recipients. We also 
include a guidelines page for quick reminders.  
[00:03:40] Returning to the donor profile, donors can earn 
verification badges for credibility and milestone  
[00:03:45] badges. By providing their name, address, 
phone number, and uploading their license,  
[00:03:50] donors can complete verification. Let's now 
look at the recipient screens. After logging in,  
[00:03:56] recipients can browse available donations and 
select the items they want. They can also view a  
[00:04:00] history of their past claim donations. If needed, 
recipients have the option to request a volunteer  
[00:04:05] to deliver their chosen items directly to 
a location of their choice. And finally,  
[00:04:11] we have the volunteer screens. Volunteer portals 
display the badges they've earned over time. They  
[00:04:16] can enter information like their name, address, 
and phone number. Volunteers have access to a map  
[00:04:21] showing nearby pickups that need to be delivered. 
After clicking confirm pickup, they complete the  
[00:04:25] task by pressing the mark as delivered button. 
Each completed trip earns volunteers a badge,  
[00:04:30] serving as motivation and recognition for 
their ongoing commitment to helping others.
[00:04:36] For the ethical AI matrix, we considered how 
our app impacts stakeholders. Under wellbeing,  
[00:04:42] it ensures food, less waste, and fulfillment 
for volunteers. For autonomy, users control  
[00:04:48] when and where to donate or pick up food. For 
fairness, everyone has equal access with no bias.  
[00:04:54] During our research, we came across apps like Too 
Good to Go, Oo, and Food Rescue Us. These apps aim  
[00:05:00] to reduce food waste, often by selling surplus 
food at discounted prices. But our focus isn't  
[00:05:06] just on reducing waste. It's on increasing 
food accessibility. Handtohand connects  
[00:05:10] excess food directly to those who need it most. 
Completely free and we handle the transportation,  
[00:05:16] too. What truly sets us apart is our unique 
blend of features. volunteer coordination,  
[00:05:22] a gamified experience to motivate users, reliable 
transportation, and free food distribution.  
[00:05:28] Transportation is only possible with volunteers, 
but we knew getting high school high schoolers  
[00:05:33] involved was a challenge. So, we asked what 
would motivate them. After serving over 200 high  
[00:05:38] schoolers, we learned that they would volunteer 
if they earn badges or service hours. Credley,  
[00:05:43] a digital badging company who whose badges can 
be sh shared on social media, allows teens to  
[00:05:49] um showcase their community impact. We 
also spoke with over five restaurants that  
[00:05:54] said that they'd donate food if they just 
had someone to pick it up. Additionally,  
[00:05:59] we have over 50 students who said that if this 
app existed today, they'd be ready to volunteer  
[00:06:03] for around 9 hours a week starting from this 
fall. We have already built a network and the  
[00:06:08] only thing left is the tool to connect them. And 
that's exactly what our app does. For the future,  
[00:06:14] Hand-O-AtoHand will add essentials 
like hygiene products such as clothing,  
[00:06:17] partner with farmers for fresh food, and 
attend farmers market to grow awareness  
[00:06:21] and volunteers. We will also recruit older 
volunteers as they are often eager to serve,  
[00:06:25] have reliable transportation, and can commit 
consistent time to our efforts. We've done the  
[00:06:30] research, we built the plan, and we have the 
people. With your support, we can bring this  
[00:06:34] to life and make a real impact. Thank you for 
listening. We're open to any questions. Amazing.
[00:06:47] Uh, so great great job. I I love this 
um this problem and the solution. Uh,  
[00:06:53] something I'm thinking a lot about is equity and 
distribution um, geographically and thinking about  
[00:07:00] um, if volunteers are local to one area, 
how you're thinking about in a given city,  
[00:07:04] how you make sure all areas were able to receive 
donations and not necessarily just those near,  
[00:07:10] you know, nice restaurants or nice universities. 
Um, and have you thought a little bit about that  
[00:07:14] and ensuring equity with the distribution? Um, 
yeah, that's definitely something we've been  
[00:07:20] thinking about. I think we plan to start small and 
locally and then expand further on. But our main  
[00:07:26] ways of reaching um student volunteers are through 
social media since a lot of teenagers are active  
[00:07:32] on social media. So Tik Tok, Instagram, and um 
other prominent platforms and I think that would  
[00:07:38] attract the most um volunteers. And of course, 
we were also talking about expanding to older um  
[00:07:45] older individuals since they're also more willing 
to volunteer their time for the community. Yeah.  
[00:07:52] And also adding on to that, yes, social media is a 
huge way to market to teens and it's where that's  
[00:07:57] most active and engaged, but also participating in 
local events like street fairs, farmers markets,  
[00:08:03] festivals is a power way to promote the 
app as well. And it the public about food  
[00:08:08] insecurity face to face combining both digital and 
community outreach which makes the biggest impact.
[00:08:21] Hi uh thank you great uh product idea and great 
uh kind of solution. So um I my question is  
[00:08:30] uh it wasn't clear to me u how do 
you determine who needs the most part  
[00:08:36] uh like how do you ensure that 
um yeah who needs the most
[00:08:48] does it make sense you um do you mean like who 
needs the food is that what you're trying to  
[00:08:55] um I I think the idea is not the recipient 
requesting for the food, but rather restaurants  
[00:09:02] donating the surplus food that they do have. 
So if a restaurant nearby has surplus food,  
[00:09:08] then volunte recipients are able to find 
that on their screen. So it I I hope that  
[00:09:14] answers your question. That's Yeah. Okay. Yeah, 
that makes sense. Thank you. This is a fabulous  
[00:09:20] idea. I'm wondering are there certain hours 
when uh like the restaurants closes at 9 or  
[00:09:28] 10 and you know the food is you know there 
are shelf life like how will you handle when  
[00:09:33] the restaurants close and when they have food 
available and then delivering it to people.
[00:09:46] So we actually have a feature on our app um on the 
app design we actually put it put it up where you  
[00:09:52] they give like an assigned time slot where like 
they can pick up the food like the volunteers  
[00:09:55] can go and pick up the food from that area. So 
that's that assigned time slot is when they can  
[00:10:01] um go and transfer the food to another place. So 
that's where like we would be able to handle our  
[00:10:07] hours. Yeah. And to add on to that, many 
restaurants do they don't sell food that  
[00:10:13] they made for lunch for their dinner. So we 
could have um these volunteers working during  
[00:10:19] lunch hours to give the surplus food that these 
restaurants won't sell to their customers during  
[00:10:25] the nighttime and they can donate instead of 
throwing these away to the people in need.
