[00:00:01] Everyone, we are team bubble bites team 
2B and we are excited to share with you  
[00:00:07] our app idea petnet. Our mentor was Anthony 
and our theme is environmental protection  
[00:00:12] and biodiversity loss. So let's meet our team 
Maxwell, myself, Ida, Christian, and Adriana.
[00:00:25] Judges, I'd like you to meet Ferto. He is 
a former stray cat that now lives with me  
[00:00:30] and my family. Faster in Spanish means 
outsider or stranger, in case you were  
[00:00:36] wondering about the odd name choice. One 
random day, as my aunt was leaving work,  
[00:00:41] she opened the car door to put down her stuff. 
Funny thing is, when she looked back up,  
[00:00:46] the cat had already hopped into the back seat. 
No warning, no invitation, just pure audacity.  
[00:00:53] Anyways, he ended up traveling with my aunt from 
Umakawa to Kajay and eventually made his way to  
[00:01:00] my house where he's lived in ever since. It was 
like he basically adopted himself. Unfortunately,  
[00:01:08] most strays don't get that happy ending. 
They don't get that goofy origin story,  
[00:01:14] and many never find their forever home. This 
is the problem we're trying to address. While  
[00:01:20] shelters are the biggest source of help, many 
are forced to euthanize the animals they can't  
[00:01:25] support. Whether it's because they don't have 
enough resources or funding or because they are  
[00:01:31] at max capacity. For these strays, it's a global 
race against the clock to find an adoptive home.  
[00:01:39] This issue was exacerbated by natural disasters 
and the COVID pandemic. To put it into numbers,  
[00:01:45] one hurricane alone added over half a million 
strays. Generational stigma leaves the government  
[00:01:51] from making the stray crisis a true priority. 
Legislation such as the Animal Protection and  
[00:01:57] Welfare Act has lacked enforcement since it has 
been implemented. There's remarkable consequences  
[00:02:03] to the surroundings as strays pose health risk 
due to transmittable diseases they carry. With  
[00:02:10] no other choice, strays are left to prey on other 
species. Our team decided that the best way to  
[00:02:18] learn about our user base was to interview local 
shelters and survey pet owners. Our responses came  
[00:02:26] from locations all over the world, Puerto Rico, 
Texas, Turkey, just to name some. Our survey  
[00:02:33] found that people have a lack of knowledge of 
shelters. It showed that they are unaware of the  
[00:02:39] roles individuals can take on to help shelters. 
participants showed hesitance to adopt to adopt  
[00:02:46] stray animals. Despite this, people's empathy 
shine through. This survey showed willingness to  
[00:02:53] adopt a stray animal if they had more knowledge of 
the circumstances and some guidance along the way.
[00:03:02] Thus, we present to you PetNet, an app 
that enables users to report strays,  
[00:03:07] help a local shelters, and teach users how to 
properly take care of their rescued pets. Our  
[00:03:14] target audience were potential and current shelter 
adopters, animal lovers, and shelters across  
[00:03:20] Puerto Rico. Our app starts off with being able to 
log in as either a shelter or an independent user  
[00:03:26] with each having different functions. Then reach 
the home screen which displays pets that are up  
[00:03:31] for adoption. Each pet profile and contains info 
on their age, name, and shelter location. Next is  
[00:03:39] the bulletin board that outside of demo purposes 
is exclusively for shelters to post opportunities  
[00:03:44] for independent users to connect with them. 
Right after that, we have the map in which users  
[00:03:49] can find local shelters. Users can also filter 
between shelters and 24/7 vets as well as contact  
[00:03:55] the shelters and donate to them to help support 
them through their struggles. After that, we have  
[00:04:00] the AI pet care assistant which uses Chad GBT and 
provides detailed AR responses to all pet specific  
[00:04:06] questions. If that's not enough, then we have the 
guides and resources section which has handmade  
[00:04:11] guides in on all aspects of pet care. This was 
done in an effort to combat pet negligence and  
[00:04:16] animal abuse with education. Each article in 
this section contains a Spanish translation as  
[00:04:22] well for extra accessibility. Finally, we have 
a stray report tool in which users can take a  
[00:04:27] picture of stray animals and report them to local 
shelters in their area. Users will then be able to  
[00:04:33] provide shelters with descriptions, location, 
and time of contact with the stray animals.
[00:04:41] Here
[00:04:46] are some of the features in order of 
implementation. For our musthaves,  
[00:04:50] we had displaying animals and their 
corresponding characteristics,  
[00:04:54] a map of shelters and their contact information, 
a bulletin highlighting different shelters,  
[00:04:59] and a donation system. For our shoulds, we 
add an AI that showcase tips to the user to  
[00:05:06] better aid them in caring for their pets and a 
reporting system. For our could haves, we add a  
[00:05:12] search bar to ease reporting, a switch language 
button, and an option to volunteer. Finally,  
[00:05:18] for our won't haves were any extraneous details 
that didn't align with our primary purpose.
[00:05:26] We identified justice, transparency, and privacy 
as important to our users. Our app helps extend  
[00:05:35] justice beyond humans to animals by giving 
shelters a platform for their services. To  
[00:05:41] be transparent, AI advice suggestions are 
clearly labeled as not meant to replace  
[00:05:46] professional advice. To protect user identity, 
all user animal reports are kept anonymous.
[00:05:57] We tested our competitors apps. Unlike our 
competitors, we allow shelters to advertise  
[00:06:02] events, find volunteers, fund raise, and 
more. We also have our AI chat that gives  
[00:06:09] care advice to ensure that your pet lives 
the life it deserves after coming home.
[00:06:18] Given more time, we hope to expand 
our services outside Puerto Rico.  
[00:06:23] We would also add other features such as sponsor 
a pet with direct donations, different language  
[00:06:30] options, and updated user profiles to improve 
accessibility, scale, and user experience.
[00:06:39] Thank you so much for listening.
[00:06:49] Well, I have to jump in here because I'm such 
a pet lover. I have a puppy right next to me,  
[00:06:54] actually. Um, so this is amazing and I 
love your branding. My one question is,  
[00:06:59] um, you have such valuable 
learning material embedded
[00:07:06] in your um I think I saw through 
the PDFs. Have you thought about any  
[00:07:11] um other formats or ways to allow people to 
learn aside from reading using your platform?  
[00:07:17] Other ways to like have them um soak in 
that information that you're providing?
[00:07:25] Well, one way would be, you know, using social 
media as a tool to make it fun. You know, people  
[00:07:31] are always on Tik Tok or reals. We could do fun 
reels that just draws people in and they're like,  
[00:07:37] "This is so funny. Let me check their profile. 
A they have cute pets. So that would be one way.  
[00:07:45] Um another one I think would be, you know, with 
our guides, they are like labeled as they're like  
[00:07:54] designed to not bore you. They're designed to like 
keep you engaged. I love that. And that's such a  
[00:08:01] good idea on because I feel like every time 
I check social media, there's someone posting  
[00:08:04] about an animal that they're trying to find 
a home for. So that's so smart. I love that.
[00:08:12] Hi. Um I love the idea as well and I I have two 
pets myself. So I'm also a big time pet lover. So  
[00:08:20] uh I love the uh the main idea that I loved was 
like connecting um being able to report stray u  
[00:08:27] pets, right? So um my question is like how do 
you feel like I have two questions. So one is  
[00:08:34] like how do you um like there can be an influx of 
um number of reports and how do you um feel about  
[00:08:42] like balancing it like there can be like too many 
stray pets how uh so you're trying to pro solve  
[00:08:48] a problem but there will be some consequence of 
it's it's a good result of it but there will be  
[00:08:54] another kind of u uh problem to address and have 
you thought about it yeah um yes so I'd like to  
[00:09:02] take this question. Um I do think that it is 
kind of again this is exactly the issue that  
[00:09:09] we are trying to address how animal shelters can 
become overcrowded which causes many animals to  
[00:09:16] unfortunately have to be let go. However, um I 
think that our app is like a good step forward  
[00:09:23] with our bulletin board, which helps um animal 
shelters advertise their um services and get more  
[00:09:30] help to get these animals into forever homes. 
Um I do believe that that would help like steer  
[00:09:38] more traffic towards um animal shelters and help 
more animals get um forever homes, which would  
[00:09:44] hopefully lessen the load on them. But um also I 
do think as a future implementation I would love  
[00:09:53] to maybe connect with foster families as well. 
So that way instead of just directing animals to  
[00:10:00] um shelters or we could also have them um go to 
foster families instead. Thank you. Thank you.  
[00:10:10] I'm also a pet lover um and I really loved your 
aim presentation. So early in your presentation,  
[00:10:17] one thing you pointed out was that there's a 
really strong desire from a lot of people to  
[00:10:21] help. Uh but aside from the tech problem, there's 
this community organization piece. Could you  
[00:10:28] expand a bit more on how you plan to combine the 
people organization piece with the technology?
[00:10:39] Yes. Um, so one of our biggest things we were also 
talking about maybe having a tool that can be used  
[00:10:48] kind of as a chat and like groups where people can 
communicate with each other and we can also just
[00:11:00] keep going. Should we please finish your 
answer? Yeah. Okay. That honestly that was  
[00:11:07] like the biggest one though where we can just make 
maybe uh where people can learn from each other,  
[00:11:13] share experiences, teach each other but 
that would be one of the biggest ones.
