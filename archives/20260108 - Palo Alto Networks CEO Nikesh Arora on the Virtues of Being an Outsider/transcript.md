[00:00:00] So many founders get trapped in this
[00:00:01] idea that I should get customers as fast
[00:00:04] as I can. I should ask them what they
[00:00:05] want. I think it's worthwhile. The best
[00:00:07] founders should actually spend some time
[00:00:09] build the product based on their own
[00:00:10] vision, show an end toend point of view
[00:00:11] and solve a real problem. For everyone
[00:00:14] who's listening or every CEO or founder
[00:00:15] is in the early part, swing big. Swing
[00:00:18] big, you fail big.
[00:00:18] >> If you're a new new CEO,
[00:00:20] >> why not swing as hard as you can, right?
[00:00:22] Take three swings. Who cares? At the end
[00:00:24] of the day, if it works out, it's going
[00:00:25] to work out spectacularly. If it doesn't
[00:00:26] work out, pack your bags and move.
[00:00:46] If you want to hear a master class on
[00:00:47] how to be a CEO, listen to this pod with
[00:00:50] Nikesh Aurora, the CEO of PaloAlto
[00:00:52] Networks. We go behind the scenes on
[00:00:55] Nikesh the man, his remarkable career,
[00:00:59] the lessons he learned from Larry Page,
[00:01:01] Eric Schmidt, and Masasan, how he became
[00:01:04] a CEO, how he actually does the job, and
[00:01:08] how he earns hundreds of millions a year
[00:01:10] doing it. We go deep into one of my
[00:01:14] favorite topics, second acts, and how
[00:01:16] great companies become platforms, which
[00:01:19] is often the difference between a really
[00:01:20] nice outcome and a legendary one. and
[00:01:22] they're pulling the legendary side off.
[00:01:24] And we go very deep on M&A.
[00:01:27] Um, and we go deep on M&A from his side,
[00:01:30] the buyer's side with some really smart
[00:01:32] acquisition practices. I really like
[00:01:35] that. But this podcast is much more for
[00:01:39] the entrepreneur. So, when I come back
[00:01:41] at the end, by the way, I'm going to
[00:01:42] back at the end with a bunch of takes on
[00:01:44] this. But one interesting take I'm going
[00:01:46] to have is I'm going to flip it around
[00:01:47] and I'm going to talk about best
[00:01:49] practices on getting acquired from the
[00:01:52] entrepreneurs perspective based on what
[00:01:53] we learned on Nash does it. So we'll see
[00:01:56] you in a bit. Hope you enjoy the
[00:01:57] podcast. Um going to be great. Okay
[00:02:00] Nashesh about 27 companies.
[00:02:03] Um things I get questions on from
[00:02:06] startups and we ask ourselves at HubSpot
[00:02:09] like we buy a company and sometimes we
[00:02:11] kind of throw a lot of it away. keep the
[00:02:15] domain expertise and the talent and
[00:02:17] rebuild it on our platform because we're
[00:02:18] a platform company and kind of our
[00:02:20] differentiation relative to Salesforce
[00:02:22] and other companies is we are kind of
[00:02:24] allin one.
[00:02:25] >> Do you ever kind of throw out a lot of
[00:02:28] it and rebuild it or do you kind of keep
[00:02:30] it all and just keep pushing it in the
[00:02:31] market?
[00:02:33] >> Look, if you think about acquisitions,
[00:02:34] they take on different forms. Now, cyber
[00:02:37] security is so fragmented that they're
[00:02:39] actually four or five swim lanes. So you
[00:02:42] could actually build a platform in every
[00:02:43] swim lane. For example, you can build an
[00:02:45] endpoint platform. You can build a sock
[00:02:47] platform. You can build a network
[00:02:49] platform. And these don't talk to each
[00:02:51] other as much. You can move data from
[00:02:52] one to the other. But yeah, you
[00:02:54] shouldn't build an endpoint stack with
[00:02:56] five different technologies. You
[00:02:57] shouldn't build a network. So there it
[00:02:59] matters if you're rewriting on your
[00:03:01] stack or not. Now you know if you think
[00:03:04] about what inspires you to go buy
[00:03:07] something versus build it yourself you
[00:03:09] know it becomes an essential feature you
[00:03:12] believe you can take the innovative lead
[00:03:14] in doing that and the process of
[00:03:16] integration is 3 months or four months
[00:03:18] and that you're willing to take that hit
[00:03:20] take for example we were never a player
[00:03:22] in sassy which is you know a form of
[00:03:25] accessing your your infrastructure
[00:03:27] remotely we saw that AI is coming There
[00:03:32] are certain use cases which are not
[00:03:33] satisfied. People have third party
[00:03:34] contractors and they try and access your
[00:03:36] systems. You have to give them a laptop
[00:03:37] and you have to be secure. And we saw
[00:03:39] the emergence of companies building an
[00:03:42] agentic sorry a secure browser
[00:03:44] >> island or talon for that matter. Right.
[00:03:47] Yes.
[00:03:48] >> And I said to my team, hey guys, this is
[00:03:51] going to be important. There's a browser
[00:03:53] coming. There are people building it. I
[00:03:55] know we've had browser fakes as in head
[00:03:57] fakes in the market. People have thought
[00:03:59] about browser going to take over the
[00:04:00] enterprise many times. But I said this
[00:04:01] time it feels real.
[00:04:03] >> So my team is always like you'd expect
[00:04:04] from any engineering team would came in
[00:04:06] and showed me a plan saying 60 engineers
[00:04:09] 9 months we'll give you a great browser.
[00:04:11] We'll be you know we'll get to where
[00:04:12] these guys are.
[00:04:13] >> And I said what do you expect? These
[00:04:14] guys just hang out wait for you to catch
[00:04:16] up with the next nine months. They'll be
[00:04:17] again nine months ahead and their team's
[00:04:19] working. They're going to add more
[00:04:19] people.
[00:04:20] >> So we ended up acquiring talent. Now
[00:04:24] we spend some time
[00:04:27] refactoring it, aligning it with our
[00:04:29] platform because remember the browser
[00:04:30] has two parts. The one part is the
[00:04:32] browser itself which is the refactoring
[00:04:33] of chromium etc. The second part is
[00:04:35] attaching security services for it to be
[00:04:37] an enterprise browser. Now what both
[00:04:39] Talon and their competitors are doing is
[00:04:41] they're buying third party security
[00:04:43] service and whoever give it to them so
[00:04:44] they could do focus of browser part. We
[00:04:46] had the third party security services.
[00:04:48] So we have premium third party security
[00:04:49] services which we can connect to the
[00:04:51] browser. So we did that in the case of
[00:04:52] talent and then we combined that with
[00:04:54] our sassy product. So we were able to go
[00:04:57] off the races from the go to market
[00:04:58] perspective saying listen we have a
[00:04:59] comprehensive solution you can get
[00:05:01] remote browser isolation you can get the
[00:05:02] browser you can get a VPN client you can
[00:05:04] get all of them with one security fabric
[00:05:06] across the board that allows us to be
[00:05:09] differentiated from our competition for
[00:05:11] a long time now as you can see perhaps
[00:05:14] it is the right bet or the market
[00:05:15] believes the right bet because the
[00:05:16] competitor is valued so highly that for
[00:05:18] anybody else in our space to compete
[00:05:20] they have to put out 8 to10 billion to
[00:05:22] compete with us. So that allows us a leg
[00:05:24] up now and I think you know where it's a
[00:05:27] comprehensive solution requirement
[00:05:28] there's nobody but us. If somebody's
[00:05:30] willing to take just a browser then
[00:05:31] there's another option in the market.
[00:05:32] >> Okay. In in that particular case you buy
[00:05:36] a very hot company.
[00:05:38] >> Yes. Hot technology. What was not clear?
[00:05:40] We paid a lot less than what the current
[00:05:42] value is. We paid like $600 or so.
[00:05:44] >> Okay. Um in the current market anyone
[00:05:47] you're buying it's expensive and the
[00:05:49] talent's expensive.
[00:05:50] >> Yes. Uh, one thing we ask ourselves at
[00:05:53] HubSpot is we buy this company, we want
[00:05:56] to retain this talent and they're
[00:05:57] incredibly valuable outside and it's
[00:06:00] incredibly valuable to them to start a
[00:06:01] new company.
[00:06:03] >> Are you doing creative things
[00:06:04] compensation wise to to the founding
[00:06:07] teams, the engineering teams to try to
[00:06:08] lock them in so they don't jump at the
[00:06:10] next huge pay package?
[00:06:12] >> Yeah. So, you know, we've had experience
[00:06:14] now doing this north of 25 times and we
[00:06:17] have a simple rule and we've learned
[00:06:19] this over the years. This was not the
[00:06:20] first time we did it. Like the first
[00:06:21] time we did it, we were like, you know,
[00:06:22] fumbling through this. But is there some
[00:06:24] fundamental principles which I think
[00:06:26] distinguished ourselves from what people
[00:06:28] have traditionally done in M&A.
[00:06:30] >> Okay.
[00:06:31] >> One, I have a simple rule. These guys
[00:06:33] kicked our ass in the market with less
[00:06:35] resources, move faster than us.
[00:06:37] >> So they must know things better than us.
[00:06:38] So they have to come and run this
[00:06:40] instead of our people. Traditionally,
[00:06:41] companies say, "Oh, meet my senior VP of
[00:06:43] crypto." And he bought a crypto company.
[00:06:45] You're going to report to him. Well, the
[00:06:46] senior VP of crypto should have kicked
[00:06:47] their ass. we have given the resource
[00:06:49] they wanted. So the founders become the
[00:06:51] bosses of our people as opposed to the
[00:06:53] other way around which our people find a
[00:06:55] little unnerving to be fair
[00:06:56] >> I would imagine.
[00:06:57] >> And but the founders find that
[00:06:58] rewarding. That's one. Two um we say how
[00:07:02] can we help you accelerate your business
[00:07:05] because we are going to have a drag on
[00:07:07] them for sure. We're a larger company.
[00:07:09] We will slow them down in some cases
[00:07:10] perhaps with our processes perhaps it's
[00:07:12] other way. So the first question is how
[00:07:13] do I accelerate your business? typically
[00:07:15] is get me more engineers right I want to
[00:07:17] move faster or let me do this
[00:07:19] >> now the third thing we do is
[00:07:22] >> we spend the diligence period designing
[00:07:24] a joint product roadmap
[00:07:26] >> okay
[00:07:26] >> we didn't do that the first two times
[00:07:27] >> okay
[00:07:28] >> so when we bought the company the
[00:07:29] founder said dude thanks for the money
[00:07:31] and thanks for letting me come here but
[00:07:32] I want to build what I want to build
[00:07:33] like dude no I just paid you a lot of
[00:07:34] money you're going to build what we
[00:07:36] agree I'm happy to agree with them and
[00:07:38] if you don't agree good news is you
[00:07:39] don't have to sell to me
[00:07:40] >> okay
[00:07:41] >> so we design an agreed product roadmap
[00:07:44] before we sign the final term.
[00:07:45] >> Okay.
[00:07:47] >> And the most importantly asked the
[00:07:48] question on talent, right? Again, I say
[00:07:50] we're buying half product and most
[00:07:52] talent
[00:07:53] >> because these things are three years in
[00:07:54] two and a half years in. I think it
[00:07:55] takes four to seven years to build a
[00:07:57] good product in tech. So, we still have
[00:07:58] two three years to go. I think the shelf
[00:08:00] life or halfife of founders is about 3
[00:08:03] years in the company.
[00:08:04] >> And do you do a three-year vest or
[00:08:05] something?
[00:08:06] >> So, we do unvest.
[00:08:08] >> Okay.
[00:08:09] >> We tell the founder, we're buying your
[00:08:10] company.
[00:08:11] >> Yeah. You have to uninvest half your
[00:08:13] stock.
[00:08:14] >> Oh, that's brutal.
[00:08:15] >> Three years. But we will top it off
[00:08:17] between 25 to 40% depending on, you
[00:08:20] know, the economics that are at play.
[00:08:22] >> I see. Okay.
[00:08:22] >> So, we'll give more equity to them.
[00:08:24] >> I see.
[00:08:24] >> That's the only time I can give them
[00:08:25] tremendous amounts of equity because
[00:08:27] part of a structured deal.
[00:08:27] >> I see. And what about a frontline
[00:08:29] engineer who's just really good? Like
[00:08:30] you've got, you buy a company, it's got
[00:08:32] 30 engineers, the founders is one thing,
[00:08:34] but all those engineers are really smart
[00:08:35] and have domain expertise. Do you do
[00:08:37] clever things with them? Do you roll
[00:08:38] them back?
[00:08:38] >> We roll some of them back. Some of them
[00:08:40] are newer to the company than the
[00:08:41] founders. So usually they have an year
[00:08:43] year or two remaining. We generally try
[00:08:45] to lock them in for the first three
[00:08:46] years.
[00:08:46] >> Three years. Yeah.
[00:08:47] >> And then what percent do you think leave
[00:08:49] after 3 years
[00:08:51] >> roughly?
[00:08:51] >> You know if you think about founders
[00:08:54] some bizarre reason there's typically
[00:08:55] more than one in tech. There's usually
[00:08:57] two on average.
[00:08:58] >> Uh usually one of them works harder than
[00:09:00] the other one.
[00:09:01] >> Okay. uh and you'll find that look
[00:09:03] around you think about think about all
[00:09:05] the tech companies which have gone
[00:09:06] through the process of multiple founders
[00:09:08] that eventually success whether it's a
[00:09:10] Facebook whether it's you know yeah
[00:09:12] YouTube you look around you all these
[00:09:13] companies where there were multiple
[00:09:15] founders eventually there's one founder
[00:09:16] front and center
[00:09:17] >> and the other founders sort of don't
[00:09:19] want to do that and they go off and do
[00:09:20] different things so typically you'll
[00:09:21] find that in every stage of a company
[00:09:23] you'll find a four-year-old company
[00:09:24] where one founder is working hard rarely
[00:09:26] do you find a company where all two or
[00:09:28] three founders are working equally hard
[00:09:30] but anyway let's assume that there's one
[00:09:32] or two it doesn't matter in this for
[00:09:34] this for these purposes right those
[00:09:36] founders are the ones we will then find
[00:09:38] a way to work with to find the identify
[00:09:40] the engineers that are needed I think at
[00:09:42] P alto I want to say the primary
[00:09:46] founders have almost all lasted the
[00:09:48] three years we've asked them to last and
[00:09:50] there are a few who lasted longer
[00:09:52] there's some founders who made more
[00:09:53] money being part of Palato than in the
[00:09:55] seven years they ran
[00:09:56] >> incredibly well yes
[00:09:57] >> yeah but if you get a lot of stock at
[00:09:59] Palto we say you can't sell it for two
[00:10:00] years sometimes to do a lot better.
[00:10:02] >> Yeah.
[00:10:02] >> Than than they would have done if they'd
[00:10:04] hung on to it.
[00:10:05] >> Yeah.
[00:10:06] >> Okay. Related to this, like at HubSpot,
[00:10:08] we do some version of horizon planning.
[00:10:11] >> H1, near-term, H2, H3.
[00:10:13] >> How do you guys do that? And how do you
[00:10:16] do it when like shit's changing so fast
[00:10:18] right now? Like it's really sped up. How
[00:10:20] do you guys think about that? Where does
[00:10:22] M&A kind of fit into all that
[00:10:25] >> or do you not do it at all? I'm trying
[00:10:27] to interpret your version of horizon
[00:10:29] planning in terms
[00:10:30] >> well like at HubSpot we look at our our
[00:10:32] like what is HubSpot going to look like
[00:10:33] in a year we want 70% of our resources
[00:10:35] on this is the next year we want 20% on
[00:10:38] stuff that's two three years out we
[00:10:40] actually want 10 on stuff that's going
[00:10:41] to be 5 years out
[00:10:42] >> got it got it
[00:10:43] >> um yeah um we do it uh because we have
[00:10:47] now multiple platforms in each platform
[00:10:49] there's a core part of the platform
[00:10:50] which is where typically 60 to 70% of
[00:10:52] resources are deployed because you're
[00:10:54] constantly adding features constantly
[00:10:55] adapting to certain customer
[00:10:56] requirements. There's 10 to 20% of the
[00:10:58] people who have to be working on new
[00:10:59] features to be launched, right? I want
[00:11:01] to see a 12 to 18 months rolling road
[00:11:03] map saying what cool thing are you going
[00:11:04] to show me? Because if you're not
[00:11:06] working on some cool thing, somebody
[00:11:07] else is. So there's a team that works on
[00:11:09] the cool things. And then there's the
[00:11:10] the 5% is the hardest part.
[00:11:13] >> The fiveyear out problem is the hardest
[00:11:16] problem because
[00:11:17] >> that's where I think is where we end up
[00:11:20] relying on M&A.
[00:11:21] >> Yeah. where there are people out there
[00:11:23] thanks to the thriving venture
[00:11:25] community. You guys are doing such a
[00:11:26] wonderful job in seeding all these
[00:11:28] research labs that I still see a few
[00:11:30] hundred companies a year and the good
[00:11:32] news is they're so great they come and
[00:11:34] share what they're working on their
[00:11:35] ideas because you know I share the view
[00:11:37] if I was so smart that I could take
[00:11:39] something from a startup and go build it
[00:11:40] faster than them then they shouldn't be
[00:11:41] in that business anyway.
[00:11:42] >> Fine. Um, a lot of the founders I coach
[00:11:47] are building apps and are trying to go
[00:11:49] on to their second app and want to build
[00:11:51] a platform. And there's this saying
[00:11:53] kicking around either you you are a
[00:11:55] platform, you get eaten by a platform. I
[00:11:58] feel like under your watch, PaloAlto
[00:12:00] became a multiplatform company.
[00:12:03] >> Advice to founders thinking about second
[00:12:05] acts, thinking about going from, you
[00:12:08] know, a point solution to a platform.
[00:12:10] Look um we didn't start as a platform
[00:12:14] company. We started as a firewall
[00:12:16] company. Yeah. When I came to Palato,
[00:12:17] you know, the last major innovation that
[00:12:19] was launched to the markets was four
[00:12:21] years before I arrived.
[00:12:23] >> And they hadn't done a lot of launches
[00:12:24] because they're very happy with the fact
[00:12:26] that firewalls were selling and we had
[00:12:27] four subscriptions and there was amazing
[00:12:28] organic growth.
[00:12:29] >> Yeah.
[00:12:30] >> I said then what's the next act? What
[00:12:31] are you going to build?
[00:12:32] >> Yeah.
[00:12:32] >> Now that's where it becomes important to
[00:12:34] have some guidelines as to what's
[00:12:36] useful, what is not useful. So I tell
[00:12:39] you a funny story. I was sitting in the
[00:12:40] room and I knew nothing about cyber
[00:12:41] security and I'm sure we'll talk about
[00:12:42] this
[00:12:43] >> and
[00:12:44] >> I said to the head of product legal I
[00:12:46] said so what are people working on like
[00:12:47] what's going on what are people working
[00:12:48] on we haven't launched anything for a
[00:12:49] while I said well you know we have this
[00:12:50] big release we do every year which is a
[00:12:52] software release for all of our
[00:12:53] firewalls I'm like that's great so what
[00:12:55] are what are these people doing this
[00:12:56] must be like 5 600 engineers so Jesse
[00:12:59] Rston our head of engineering came in
[00:13:00] and he brought two of his colleagues
[00:13:02] he's meeting the new CEO and he's going
[00:13:03] to tell him what to do so I said what
[00:13:05] are you working on I was very excited he
[00:13:06] says okay
[00:13:07] >> I'm working on 60 new features for our
[00:13:09] new software for for a new software
[00:13:11] upgrade for the firewall. I'm like,
[00:13:12] that's cool. Is that going to help you
[00:13:14] sell more firewalls? I don't know.
[00:13:17] That's kind of like sounds like a lot of
[00:13:18] work for 600 people. And I'm like, so am
[00:13:20] I going make money? I know we're going
[00:13:21] to sell more firewalls. Okay, that's do
[00:13:23] me a favor. Three, if you're working on
[00:13:24] it six months like I said, here's the
[00:13:26] marker whiteboard. Just write down the
[00:13:29] 60 features.
[00:13:31] So, they got exhausted after 37.
[00:13:33] >> Okay.
[00:13:34] >> I said, you do realize we've got a
[00:13:36] problem. He said, what's the problem? I
[00:13:38] said, "I got sales people out there.
[00:13:41] They got to sell this stuff. You're
[00:13:42] building it. You're smarter. You can't
[00:13:44] remember past 37. How the hell am I
[00:13:46] sales people going to learn 60 new
[00:13:47] features which are going to be for
[00:13:48] free?"
[00:13:49] >> No way.
[00:13:50] >> This is the problem. And this is tells
[00:13:51] you how how marginally competent I was.
[00:13:54] In on that 37 things, there were seven
[00:13:57] lines which said DNS on them. That seems
[00:14:00] to be a bit thematic. Talk to me about
[00:14:01] DNS security. So, they told me about DNS
[00:14:03] security, told me about infoblocks, told
[00:14:05] me about all the stuff that was going
[00:14:06] on. I said, "So, can we replace a DNS
[00:14:10] security vendor if we do this?" Oh, no.
[00:14:12] We've solved 60% of the problem, but the
[00:14:14] other 40% is harder and requires a
[00:14:16] little more work than what we can do in
[00:14:18] the OS. I like 60% not good enough, bud.
[00:14:21] Like, what am I going to do with the
[00:14:22] other 40%. So, that day we redirected
[00:14:26] the rest of the effort for the next four
[00:14:27] months into making the DNS security more
[00:14:30] robust. That was the first piece of
[00:14:32] innovation we launched at Palato.
[00:14:33] >> That was your second act.
[00:14:35] >> That was my first or first act company's
[00:14:37] second act.
[00:14:38] >> Well, that was the beginning of the
[00:14:39] company's second act. The reason I tell
[00:14:41] the story is
[00:14:43] >> that was the beginnings of the idea of a
[00:14:45] platform. Which means if you have a
[00:14:46] firewall which is being deployed by our
[00:14:48] customers, they trust us to go in and
[00:14:50] get inline. They buy four subscriptions
[00:14:52] from us. What other sliver feature
[00:14:55] industries as part of our ecosystem can
[00:14:58] we eliminate by giving them a fifth,
[00:15:00] 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th to 10th? So actually
[00:15:03] >> over the course of the last seven years
[00:15:04] we launched six others. So we have 11
[00:15:06] subscriptions now that can be sold on
[00:15:09] the platform. I.e. you buy the hardware
[00:15:10] box and now I can do 11 different things
[00:15:12] which are all 11 billion you know
[00:15:15] lateral markets that get consolidated on
[00:15:17] the platform.
[00:15:18] >> So that was kind of the beginning of the
[00:15:19] idea of a platform.
[00:15:20] >> But
[00:15:21] >> I sat there and said how many cyber
[00:15:23] security products are there? There were
[00:15:24] a lot. There are five swim lanes. There
[00:15:26] are many products. And I said we're only
[00:15:27] in one magic quadrant. Looks like this
[00:15:29] is something important. I was like
[00:15:30] feeling my way through cyber security
[00:15:32] through enterprise. Like why can't we we
[00:15:34] be on more magic quadrant? So today
[00:15:35] we're north of 24 magic coordinates.
[00:15:38] >> That was great. So we're very good, very
[00:15:40] well done. Lots of point products sold
[00:15:41] by produced by Palo Alto. And they said,
[00:15:43] "By the way, the problem is each of
[00:15:44] these require their own validation,
[00:15:46] their own specialists, their own
[00:15:47] convincing the customer." I said, "This
[00:15:49] is not how we're going to do it. Let's
[00:15:51] make sure now that we have 24 great
[00:15:53] products. We stitch them that they work
[00:15:54] better together." Yeah.
[00:15:55] >> Which became sort of the next push
[00:15:58] behind platformization. So
[00:16:00] >> when was that? This was about three
[00:16:02] years ago when we started stitching them
[00:16:04] into three platforms. Our network
[00:16:05] security platform, our cloud platform
[00:16:07] and our our cortex sim platform and then
[00:16:09] you discovered that when we talked to
[00:16:12] customers about the platform, it was
[00:16:14] open season. There was nobody else in
[00:16:16] the conversation cuz we were going and
[00:16:17] saying listen, we don't want you to buy
[00:16:18] just a point solution. Look, these six
[00:16:20] things work together. And once we get
[00:16:22] people convinced on the platform, then
[00:16:24] they start a journey and moving to Palo
[00:16:26] Alto, which is great because we have
[00:16:28] very low churn on our platform sales and
[00:16:31] their customers are happy. They get
[00:16:33] deployed
[00:16:34] >> and they would never rip out a platform
[00:16:35] and go back and say, "Oh, let me go
[00:16:37] build six point products and go to
[00:16:38] replace Pala with those six point
[00:16:39] products." So, it kind of worked out,
[00:16:41] but you can't start there.
[00:16:42] >> Yeah.
[00:16:43] >> You have to start with an MVP with
[00:16:45] something that's innovative that's going
[00:16:46] to make you win. And then customers you
[00:16:48] get their trust and say by the way I
[00:16:49] also do this and what I do here is also
[00:16:52] as good as everybody else if not better.
[00:16:53] >> Yes. You have to get to table stakes at
[00:16:55] some level.
[00:16:55] >> That's right. And that's where if you're
[00:16:57] building the next app if you have one
[00:16:59] app the question is what is a lateral
[00:17:00] app where you to use the cliche 1 plus 1
[00:17:03] is three. If your app and this other app
[00:17:05] works together does it create a better
[00:17:06] outcome and does allow me as a customer
[00:17:08] to replace that? when you're you're
[00:17:11] planning this stuff,
[00:17:13] how much of PaloAlto is you or your team
[00:17:18] looking around a corner versus, you
[00:17:20] know, we just got to listen to customers
[00:17:22] about what customers want.
[00:17:24] >> That's a tough one. You know, you want
[00:17:27] to say we listen to customers, so we do.
[00:17:29] >> Yes.
[00:17:29] >> Uh but my customers are not going to
[00:17:32] tell me that browser's next.
[00:17:33] >> Yep.
[00:17:34] >> Right. I literally we had our summit
[00:17:36] last week in Napa and we had a bunch of
[00:17:38] CIOS there and literally showing them
[00:17:40] the browser, showing them the value of
[00:17:41] the browser and you know they oh my god
[00:17:44] this is cool can you spin up one for me
[00:17:46] literally spinning up tenants for our
[00:17:47] customers to try the browser and they
[00:17:49] look and say holy why are we not
[00:17:50] doing this stuff so they wouldn't be
[00:17:52] telling me because they would tell me
[00:17:53] the 27 reasons why browsers never worked
[00:17:55] in the enterprise for many years but now
[00:17:57] I tell them really you don't think in
[00:17:58] six to 12 months from now you'll have
[00:18:00] multiple agentic browsers who will want
[00:18:02] to take over credentials and do tasks
[00:18:04] for
[00:18:05] and you don't want to find a way to
[00:18:06] control them. Oh you're right. We
[00:18:08] better go get our act together and go
[00:18:10] figure the browser stuff up. So I think
[00:18:11] many cases you end up with customers who
[00:18:13] either will tell you incremental
[00:18:15] features. Like I had a customer once I
[00:18:16] was sitting there and saying listen
[00:18:18] >> would like you to take this uh network
[00:18:20] security platform from us and by the way
[00:18:22] we have telemetry, we have metering, we
[00:18:24] have observability in the platform and
[00:18:26] we have all these cool things in SDWAN.
[00:18:29] And he says, "Where do I manually do
[00:18:33] traffic steering in your platform?" I'm
[00:18:35] like, "You want to do what?" So, I want
[00:18:37] to do manual traffic steering. I'm
[00:18:38] saying, "You run a very large network.
[00:18:40] You actually believe you have the mental
[00:18:42] capacity in your team to do manual
[00:18:43] traffic switching.
[00:18:45] >> There's no such option." Now the problem
[00:18:47] is the risk is sometime this one was
[00:18:49] obvious but the problem is there are
[00:18:50] many times the customers ask you for
[00:18:51] stuff that is something they're used to
[00:18:54] doing in a different product or a
[00:18:55] different way and now you're suddenly
[00:18:56] working backwards creating backward
[00:18:58] compatibility. So you got to watch out
[00:19:00] for what the right balance is between
[00:19:02] sort of you know
[00:19:04] >> don't listen too hard. Yeah, you have to
[00:19:06] adapt to their requirements to some
[00:19:08] degree so you can make their stuff work.
[00:19:09] But you got to be careful about getting
[00:19:11] full feature knowledge about the future
[00:19:13] because you take the example the reason
[00:19:15] by the way this is this is pertinent to
[00:19:16] cyber security cyber security founders
[00:19:19] have this strange affliction they will
[00:19:22] start building and they want to go out
[00:19:25] there and talk to customers as quickly
[00:19:26] as they can. It's like literally three
[00:19:28] six months in they're talking to their
[00:19:30] buddy CESOS have these customer advisory
[00:19:32] councils. They bring all these people in
[00:19:33] give them some advisory shares. I ask
[00:19:35] them what do you think? Now typically
[00:19:37] people who have their free time are
[00:19:38] large enterprise sees or CIOS. So
[00:19:41] they'll hang out with you, they'll come
[00:19:42] to your offsite, they'll give you
[00:19:43] advice. Large infrastructure people
[00:19:46] don't want UI.
[00:19:48] >> They want speeds and feeds.
[00:19:49] >> So typically they point the founders
[00:19:51] towards speeds and feeds.
[00:19:53] >> Founders feel really happy. Oh my god, I
[00:19:55] built speed and feeds and look this bank
[00:19:56] is using me because this bank's got
[00:19:58] 15,000 engineers. They want speeds and
[00:20:00] fees because you found some threat
[00:20:01] vector and they'll take the speed and
[00:20:02] feed put in their system. The problem is
[00:20:04] that's not a product. That's not a
[00:20:05] product an enterprise can deploy or work
[00:20:07] with or use effectively. So many
[00:20:10] founders get trapped in this idea that I
[00:20:12] should get customers as fast as I can. I
[00:20:14] should ask them what they want. I think
[00:20:16] it's worthwhile. The best founders
[00:20:17] should actually spend some time build a
[00:20:19] product based on their own vision, show
[00:20:20] an end toend point of view and solve a
[00:20:22] real problem. That was the case with
[00:20:24] HubSpot. We built stuff that
[00:20:27] first of all investors thought we were
[00:20:28] stupid.
[00:20:30] VC.
[00:20:31] >> I'm sure they love you now because you
[00:20:32] did a great outcome for them. So
[00:20:34] >> we did our series A.
[00:20:35] >> It's easy to change their mind.
[00:20:36] Customers a little harder.
[00:20:37] >> Yes, we did our series A was five on a
[00:20:39] six pre.
[00:20:41] Give away a lot of the company series A.
[00:20:43] >> That sounds like a like a angel check
[00:20:45] right now.
[00:20:45] >> Yeah, totally. Um, as I listen to you
[00:20:50] and I think about your journey,
[00:20:53] there's a couple things I think are
[00:20:54] great and unusual about you. One is they
[00:20:58] hired you from the outside and you
[00:21:01] weren't a security guy and you had to
[00:21:04] figure it out.
[00:21:05] >> I wasn't an enterprise CEO either,
[00:21:07] >> right? And so
[00:21:09] I have a lot of questions along this
[00:21:11] line, but you figured it out. Like
[00:21:13] you're in meetings with your team with
[00:21:14] the team and
[00:21:17] I'm sure in a lot of meetings you know
[00:21:18] what the hell they were talking about.
[00:21:20] >> I still have that sometimes.
[00:21:21] >> I guess uh how do you walk that line?
[00:21:25] How did you learn? How did you keep How
[00:21:27] did you not lose credibility and have
[00:21:29] them eye roll at you?
[00:21:31] >> I think all of that was has happened.
[00:21:32] I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure the eye
[00:21:34] rolling's happened. I'm pretty sure some
[00:21:35] left. It's still happening. Well, you
[00:21:37] know, a little less now
[00:21:39] >> because uh like you said, the stock's
[00:21:41] done well, the company has done well.
[00:21:42] So, people like to win and they figured
[00:21:44] that somewhere in my madness there is a
[00:21:46] way to win. So, they go with it and give
[00:21:48] me the benefit of doubt because it's
[00:21:49] worked out so far. But, yes, if it
[00:21:51] doesn't work for a while, they start
[00:21:52] wondering what the hell is this guy
[00:21:53] doing again. So,
[00:21:54] >> yeah. When you first came in though,
[00:21:55] like
[00:21:56] >> you didn't know a lot about it. Like
[00:21:58] what was it?
[00:21:58] >> Nothing. Let's be clear. This is you
[00:22:00] don't have to be polite. I didn't know
[00:22:01] anything. Okay. I literally thought
[00:22:03] cyber security was two different words.
[00:22:04] So I didn't know it was one word. Okay.
[00:22:06] Right. And I walked in and I'm talking
[00:22:07] about like executive security or
[00:22:10] whatever. Like I didn't know what cyber
[00:22:11] security was. And I'm sitting there and
[00:22:13] talking to to you know our friend Jim
[00:22:15] Gats or Ashim Chana who were part of the
[00:22:16] hiring committee. Yeah. I think I got
[00:22:18] hired because he had risk-taking venture
[00:22:20] capitalist nomination committee which is
[00:22:21] a good lesson by the way for companies.
[00:22:23] They should have some people who have a
[00:22:25] higher risk appetite in their non-gov
[00:22:27] committees to hire people because
[00:22:28] otherwise you fall into the trap of very
[00:22:30] traditional people who are checking
[00:22:32] boxes to hire people and they don't
[00:22:33] >> I violently agree with that.
[00:22:34] >> Yes, I think so. That's kind of an
[00:22:36] interesting you know and of course
[00:22:38] >> and generally nom and gov people are not
[00:22:40] risk-seeking types of people.
[00:22:41] >> Boards are not right. I mean public
[00:22:43] company board you're getting paid
[00:22:45] nothing right? You have zero appetite to
[00:22:47] take risk. You can only get into trouble
[00:22:49] for making a bad decision. You don't get
[00:22:50] rewarded for making a good good
[00:22:52] decision. So what do you do? You risk
[00:22:53] manage.
[00:22:54] >> So and risk management, you know, the
[00:22:56] the most riskmanaged portfolio is the
[00:22:58] S&P 500. It gives you market returns. So
[00:23:01] you risk management hiring, you end up
[00:23:02] with market returns. That's a good
[00:23:04] outcome.
[00:23:04] >> We have a section in our board meeting
[00:23:05] once a year. It's erm enterprise risk
[00:23:08] management.
[00:23:09] >> And my co-founder made a joke. He said,
[00:23:11] "Those are your three those are your
[00:23:12] three least favorite words in the
[00:23:14] English language."
[00:23:17] >> I think we have one of those, too.
[00:23:18] >> Yeah. You didn't know what you're doing.
[00:23:20] You joined. How did you How did you What
[00:23:22] the hell were you doing?
[00:23:24] >> First of all, why did you take the gig?
[00:23:26] >> You know, I uh was home for a year and a
[00:23:29] half and you'll be surprised. Not many
[00:23:31] people want
[00:23:33] >> CEO from the outside for a substantive
[00:23:36] business. Usually, they're very broken.
[00:23:38] >> And you sit there and say, why would
[00:23:39] anybody touch this job? So, you don't
[00:23:41] want those. uh or they have currently in
[00:23:44] the current tech environment usually
[00:23:45] there's a founder who doesn't like doing
[00:23:47] certain parts of their job and they want
[00:23:48] to hire someone to do that part of the
[00:23:49] job but they still want to be around and
[00:23:51] run the company and I've been there done
[00:23:53] that take the box
[00:23:54] >> and then you sometimes you find these
[00:23:56] gems where which are fully public
[00:23:58] there's no controlling shareholder the
[00:24:00] founder has never been CEO doesn't want
[00:24:01] to be CEO he wants to be a technologist
[00:24:04] and he's and it's a well-run company
[00:24:06] decently run company it was you know
[00:24:07] Mark Mclofflin my predistor was amazing
[00:24:09] guy he built this on a very high
[00:24:11] integrity culture Sure. So you had
[00:24:13] something great to work with from from
[00:24:15] sort of the the the bones of it and then
[00:24:18] you're in a market which is going to be
[00:24:19] amazing because cyber security is a
[00:24:20] market which is going to keep growing as
[00:24:22] tech keeps growing. Cyber security is
[00:24:23] going to keep growing and then the sort
[00:24:24] of the icing on the cake is like it's
[00:24:26] got one and a half% market share which
[00:24:28] means this is an industry ripe to
[00:24:30] consolidate in some way shape or form
[00:24:32] why can't there be a 10 or 20% share
[00:24:34] player in this space which is which is
[00:24:37] traditional for most tech. That was my
[00:24:39] thesis walking in. So I actually didn't
[00:24:41] study cyber security to understand Palo
[00:24:44] Alto. I sat there and say how does
[00:24:46] enterprise companies work. If you do
[00:24:48] enterprise math it kind of falls into
[00:24:49] two very simple places right. So any
[00:24:51] founder is thinking about scaling their
[00:24:53] company
[00:24:54] >> has to think about two different
[00:24:55] scenarios. One scenario is it works in
[00:24:58] the I call it productled growth model
[00:25:02] where you build a great product people
[00:25:03] adopt it your cost of sales are
[00:25:05] dimminimous whether the Atlassians the
[00:25:07] world or the Adobe one part of their
[00:25:09] business or the Dropbox is the world
[00:25:10] there's there
[00:25:11] >> and they they usually struggle to do the
[00:25:14] larger enterprise deals because the
[00:25:15] product's not designed for that as well
[00:25:17] the enterprise guys want way more
[00:25:19] features want way more adaptation so
[00:25:20] usually end up doing really well in the
[00:25:22] packaged software packaged solution
[00:25:24] business. and it with some sort of
[00:25:26] little dials but your UI is pretty
[00:25:28] because you want to convince customers
[00:25:29] you're almost like a consumer company in
[00:25:31] a product like that's kind of one part
[00:25:33] of the business that's good because if
[00:25:35] you look at the other side I have very
[00:25:38] simple maths you know so I'm like
[00:25:39] looking and saying look if you look at
[00:25:40] the enterprise business sub billion
[00:25:42] dollars your cost of sales marketing and
[00:25:46] support is 60 to 80%.
[00:25:48] >> Yeah it's huge
[00:25:49] >> that's what it is the rest of it is only
[00:25:51] 20 to 30%. And even at scale that goes
[00:25:54] down to 18 to 25%. So there's not much
[00:25:57] spread there. All the profit is made in
[00:25:59] optimizing that 80%.
[00:26:01] >> How do you do that without crushing
[00:26:02] growth?
[00:26:03] >> That's a good question.
[00:26:04] >> Thank you.
[00:26:05] >> You don't you don't crush growth. You
[00:26:08] need to be of a certain size and scale.
[00:26:09] So the first thing I did uh amongst many
[00:26:12] things is I took our operating margin
[00:26:15] down from 20 plus% to 17%.
[00:26:18] >> I actually invested 500 basis points
[00:26:20] more into growth. like we're too we're
[00:26:21] not investing enough.
[00:26:22] >> Right? So that like that coupled with no
[00:26:25] knowledge of cyber security really made
[00:26:27] people's eyes go like oh this guy
[00:26:28] just walked in wants to hire more
[00:26:30] engineers buy more companies use up the
[00:26:32] company's cash and reduce our operating
[00:26:34] margin. That sounds great.
[00:26:35] >> Yeah. Okay.
[00:26:36] >> Let's start
[00:26:36] >> really popular.
[00:26:37] >> Very popular. And then I walk in I
[00:26:40] literally just walk into the company
[00:26:41] like what am I doing here? To your point
[00:26:42] the first six months I didn't know.
[00:26:43] >> Did you feel that way?
[00:26:44] >> I did.
[00:26:45] >> Yeah.
[00:26:45] >> I walked in but remember I I I'll tell
[00:26:48] you a different story. So this was
[00:26:50] taught to me by a fund manager. My first
[00:26:53] job in the United States. Well, my first
[00:26:55] job which I loved was I was a buyside
[00:26:58] analyst and I walked in and my job was
[00:27:02] to analyze stocks in front of stand in
[00:27:03] front of very opinionated portfolio
[00:27:05] managers and tell them why to buy the
[00:27:06] stock.
[00:27:06] >> Yep.
[00:27:07] >> And it didn't really matter. I mean,
[00:27:09] come on. You're reading about the stock.
[00:27:11] There was no chat GBD to summarize stuff
[00:27:13] for me. There was no Google search. Then
[00:27:14] you had to go read a bunch of financial
[00:27:16] reports, put it together, do a
[00:27:17] spreadsheet, put a model together and
[00:27:19] tweak some numbers and say, "I think we
[00:27:20] should buy the store."
[00:27:21] >> Y
[00:27:22] >> and you have to do that based on some
[00:27:23] speeches of the CEO and CFO had made or
[00:27:25] you'd met them once for half an hour.
[00:27:27] That's kind of like pretty out there to
[00:27:29] go do that stuff. Anyway, we did that.
[00:27:30] The problem was two weeks later they
[00:27:33] would do something different than your
[00:27:34] thesis. Now you had a choice. You could
[00:27:36] change your opinion based on that and
[00:27:39] get buffeted by that and go to the port
[00:27:41] and say, "Hey, I was wrong. I changed my
[00:27:42] opinion." and then two weeks later do
[00:27:43] something else. Or you could have to
[00:27:46] deal with all the uncertainty inside and
[00:27:47] still maintain your thesis on some way,
[00:27:49] shape or form. So you had to decide what
[00:27:50] a long-term thesis was and deal with the
[00:27:52] uncertainty amongst yourself without
[00:27:54] making it visible. That's what I learned
[00:27:55] when I was way younger than today. I
[00:27:58] said kind of like walking into politics,
[00:28:00] I felt the same way. I said I had to
[00:28:01] keep my insecurities inside me. I had to
[00:28:04] keep my my convictions inside me. Sort
[00:28:07] of be like a duck, you know, like be
[00:28:09] serene on top but paddle furiously
[00:28:10] underneath and try and get my
[00:28:11] together. what I was trying to do and I
[00:28:14] used to call near Zuk our founder either
[00:28:17] in the morning or in the evening on my
[00:28:18] way to or from work and I used to call
[00:28:20] Lee Clarage the chief product officer
[00:28:21] the other time and I'd spend half an
[00:28:22] hour 45 minutes asking them all kinds of
[00:28:24] questions and then I'd call Mark
[00:28:25] Mclofflin sometimes because he was still
[00:28:27] available as an adviser board member I'd
[00:28:29] call Ashim I'd call Jim I'd be calling
[00:28:31] these people all the time I don't know
[00:28:32] how many phone calls I've made
[00:28:34] >> I saw 300 plus cyber security startups
[00:28:36] in the first six months I was there
[00:28:37] >> cuz I was just trying to learn absorb
[00:28:39] >> so that allowed me to start building a
[00:28:42] mental framework as to how this thing
[00:28:44] should work. But I knew we were subscale
[00:28:47] less than $2 billion in revenue with SBC
[00:28:49] north of 15%. We were not set up as a
[00:28:52] good long-term public company. And
[00:28:54] watching the, you know, the the half
[00:28:57] cycle of a cyber security company is 10
[00:28:59] years.
[00:28:59] >> In 20 years, they're gone.
[00:29:01] >> Yeah.
[00:29:01] >> So, we're already past our halfway mark.
[00:29:03] >> Yeah.
[00:29:04] >> So, I'm like, oh my god, this is a this
[00:29:06] is a known formula. You take a look at
[00:29:08] the semantics, the McAfei of the world.
[00:29:09] There's a whole bunch of, you know,
[00:29:11] carcasses in enterprise which didn't
[00:29:12] cross the 1015 billion Rubicon of market
[00:29:15] cap. So, we got to go get past that. The
[00:29:17] only way to get past that is to grow our
[00:29:19] way out of our space in the market. We
[00:29:22] were one of seven companies below $20
[00:29:23] billion, above 10.
[00:29:24] >> Yep.
[00:29:25] >> Like we got to get past this 20, 30, 40
[00:29:27] billion mark because we can that the
[00:29:28] only way to get there is through revenue
[00:29:30] growth. Once you get revenue growth,
[00:29:31] then you can start worrying about
[00:29:32] optimizing your sales and marketing cost
[00:29:34] because then you can see how to. So my
[00:29:36] only focus when I started buying stuff
[00:29:37] was I'm listen to a customer and you
[00:29:40] have an expensive salesperson most
[00:29:41] expensive resource and they walk and
[00:29:43] say, "Hey, would you like a firewall
[00:29:44] guy?" I said, "I just bought one." I was
[00:29:45] like, "Oh I can't go back for
[00:29:46] seven years to this guy."
[00:29:47] >> Totally.
[00:29:48] >> So your conversion rate is very low. But
[00:29:50] say you don't want a firewall, you want
[00:29:51] endpoint security. If you don't want
[00:29:52] that, you want some cloud security. You
[00:29:53] want that? You want some SDWAN? I got
[00:29:55] something to sell you. Yeah.
[00:29:57] >> But just it's higher conversion.
[00:29:58] advertise my sales people a lot easier.
[00:30:00] So, that was a very simple insight I
[00:30:01] walked in with saying if I can sell more
[00:30:03] stuff to the same customer,
[00:30:05] there's a higher probability I can get
[00:30:07] through my operating margin dilemma.
[00:30:09] >> Back to you.
[00:30:10] >> Yes.
[00:30:11] >> It sounded like you have a little or at
[00:30:13] least had imposter syndrome and you hit
[00:30:15] it pretty well.
[00:30:16] >> I have it. I have it right now actually.
[00:30:19] I'm nerv I'm a little bit nervous
[00:30:21] interviewing you.
[00:30:21] >> Oh, you shouldn't be nervous. like is is
[00:30:23] is
[00:30:25] we all have
[00:30:27] the fear of what we don't know and fear
[00:30:29] of making a wrong choice. Um there's a
[00:30:32] balance. There are some people you can
[00:30:34] show your willingness to adapt or
[00:30:37] uncertainty if it depends on how you
[00:30:38] want to call it or the respect for their
[00:30:41] superior knowledge. Um and then you have
[00:30:45] to hold it off from the others. So with
[00:30:46] Near and Lee, I was very comfortable
[00:30:48] talking to them or Mark, I was very
[00:30:49] comfortable talking to them about what I
[00:30:50] was learning because they needed to
[00:30:52] understand. They were aware of it. And
[00:30:53] by the way, they were they knew when I
[00:30:55] interviewed the first time when they
[00:30:57] offered me the job, I said, "Actually, I
[00:30:58] want another another set of interviews."
[00:31:00] They're like, "What?" I say, "Yes, I
[00:31:02] want to go back and talk to Ne and Lee
[00:31:04] and Mark." So actually, when the job was
[00:31:06] offered to me, I said, "Hold the offer.
[00:31:07] I'm going to go back to talk to them
[00:31:09] because the last time they were
[00:31:10] interviewing me. This time I want to
[00:31:11] interview them." So I went back and I
[00:31:12] said, "Listen, guys, you do understand
[00:31:13] what you're signing up for. I do not
[00:31:15] understand cyber security. You get it?
[00:31:17] They're like, "Yes, we get it. We have
[00:31:18] 5,000 people who do." And we're still
[00:31:20] trying to make sense of it. I said,
[00:31:21] "Okay, that's good." One, I said, "Two,
[00:31:23] remember this is going to be one
[00:31:24] company. It's not going to be one sales
[00:31:26] company and one product company. So, I'm
[00:31:28] not coming to fix sales. I'm trying to
[00:31:30] run the company."
[00:31:31] >> Mhm.
[00:31:31] >> So, I literally had Lee and Ne commit to
[00:31:35] the fact that they were signing up for
[00:31:36] the unknown entity known as Nikash, who
[00:31:39] didn't know anything about cyber
[00:31:40] security, and they'd guide me and work
[00:31:42] with me for me to get to a place where
[00:31:43] we can make this work. So I was very
[00:31:45] comfortable with sharing with them what
[00:31:46] I was learning, what I didn't know. And
[00:31:48] that kind of gave me some comfort and
[00:31:50] courage. But you can still walk into
[00:31:52] meetings where you have a distinguished
[00:31:53] engineer sitting there saying, "Who is
[00:31:55] this guy just why did he show up here?
[00:31:56] And why does he get the big bucks to go
[00:31:58] tell me?"
[00:31:58] >> You showed it to a small circle, but to
[00:32:00] the company, you didn't show that
[00:32:01] imposttor syndrome.
[00:32:03] >> No. Um,
[00:32:04] >> you showed a face of somewhat confident.
[00:32:06] >> I was learning. Look, we I joined in
[00:32:08] April, September. We didn't analyst put
[00:32:10] out a target saying do a billion dollars
[00:32:11] of next generation security ARR which we
[00:32:14] didn't have a next generation product we
[00:32:16] didn't have anything we have sales
[00:32:17] people were going to build a billion
[00:32:18] dollar AR business in three years we
[00:32:20] built a larger than billion dollar
[00:32:22] business in three years so sometimes you
[00:32:24] know you I think look in my rule is very
[00:32:27] simple I did this before I used to work
[00:32:29] at T-Mobile I took a job at Google I
[00:32:30] took a pay cut and I didn't know how to
[00:32:32] sell advertising I didn't know what ad
[00:32:34] how advertising was sold I ran Google
[00:32:37] Europe we all sold advertising I had to
[00:32:38] figure it out. And my view for everyone
[00:32:41] who's listening or every CEO or founder
[00:32:43] is in the early part, swing big. Swing
[00:32:46] big, you fail big.
[00:32:47] >> If you're a new new CEO,
[00:32:48] >> why not swing as hard as you can, right?
[00:32:50] Take three swings. Who cares? At the end
[00:32:52] of the day, if it works out, it's going
[00:32:53] to work out spectacularly. If it doesn't
[00:32:55] work out, pack your bags and move.
[00:32:56] >> Okay, let me ask it related I have like
[00:32:58] a million more questions, but related to
[00:33:00] that,
[00:33:01] >> when we would hire people at HubSpot,
[00:33:03] >> Yes. And we had this thesis like give
[00:33:04] them a lot of time, let them interview
[00:33:06] and slowly come up to speed. But
[00:33:08] actually the current CEO of HubSpot
[00:33:09] joined like the week before co and she
[00:33:13] got thrown into it and she did great.
[00:33:15] What is your sort of philosophy on that
[00:33:17] kind of thing?
[00:33:18] >> Like you got thrown in.
[00:33:19] >> Yeah.
[00:33:20] >> And you went after it. You're you've got
[00:33:22] an amazing exec team there. You bring
[00:33:23] someone in from the outside kind of slow
[00:33:25] roll them or you throw them in the fire.
[00:33:27] Look, it's very hard to
[00:33:31] fly a plane by sitting next to the
[00:33:33] person flying the plane.
[00:33:34] >> Yeah.
[00:33:35] >> So, if you are going to fly the plane,
[00:33:36] if you're competent, you know how to fly
[00:33:37] it, you got to go sit in the pilot seat.
[00:33:40] So, you can't like slow roll a CEO into
[00:33:42] the role. Now, look, when I took the job
[00:33:45] at Google for 3 months, I didn't
[00:33:48] >> decide anything.
[00:33:49] >> I just said, "You guys keep doing what
[00:33:50] you're doing." Look, most companies will
[00:33:52] run for two, three months without
[00:33:53] interfering, anyone interfering. Like
[00:33:55] the biggest decision I had to make when
[00:33:57] I walked in was, "Oh my god, it's
[00:33:58] performance season. We have this money
[00:34:00] left on our equity budget. We like to
[00:34:02] give it like in India." I said, "Sure,
[00:34:03] go right ahead." And then I had to go
[00:34:05] fight SBC out. So you I got I had to pay
[00:34:07] for my bad decisions. But the point is I
[00:34:10] didn't have to make any important
[00:34:11] decisions for those first three months.
[00:34:12] Things were working. People want to do
[00:34:14] their jobs and it ran in a very
[00:34:16] non-interfering way. So I think most
[00:34:18] companies
[00:34:20] >> should be able to run 3 to 6 months on
[00:34:22] autopilot within reason. M
[00:34:24] >> but after 3 to 6 months the lack of
[00:34:26] strong decision making in those periods
[00:34:28] starts to show up you starts having
[00:34:30] impact right so hopefully your
[00:34:31] predecessor set it up in a way that is
[00:34:33] still rolling on good decisions that
[00:34:35] were made before now you got to go jump
[00:34:36] in and see which decisions do I need to
[00:34:38] make so I think there is some time that
[00:34:40] people can take to figure stuff out
[00:34:42] >> just kind of back on you personally you
[00:34:44] strike me as I don't know you super well
[00:34:46] but you strike me as being very calm and
[00:34:50] you don't seem stressed out and I coach
[00:34:52] tons of CEOs are like all the SEOA CEOs.
[00:34:56] They're stressed. Um
[00:34:59] >> stressed for what?
[00:35:00] >> They're just stressed like existential
[00:35:02] levels of stress. Like am I correct?
[00:35:05] You're you don't you strike me as a
[00:35:06] pretty cool customer.
[00:35:07] >> My my work doesn't stress me.
[00:35:10] >> Has it ever or did it in the beginning
[00:35:12] and now you kind of got your legs under
[00:35:13] you?
[00:35:14] >> No, my work's not stressed me. And you
[00:35:18] know, even my wife wonders like where do
[00:35:20] you get the conviction from? Like
[00:35:21] >> where do you get it?
[00:35:23] I had no belief in myself that
[00:35:25] >> where did that come from?
[00:35:26] >> Maybe growing up,
[00:35:27] >> mom, dad.
[00:35:29] >> It's It's kind of like I was that kid. I
[00:35:32] was that kid who get home on time, get
[00:35:33] my homework done, not worry about my
[00:35:35] parents telling me to do it, you know,
[00:35:37] make my bed, be the good kid, and get
[00:35:40]  done. And it's kind of like, you
[00:35:43] know, in a way, sometimes your parents
[00:35:46] actively encourage you. Sometimes they
[00:35:48] don't interfere and they let you do your
[00:35:50] thing because you believe but you know
[00:35:52] they have your back.
[00:35:53] >> So I think knowing that somebody has my
[00:35:55] back and I'm well protected, well
[00:35:58] covered is usually what's made me do
[00:36:00] better. And at Palo Alto, the best part
[00:36:02] is I have an amazing board and I know my
[00:36:05] board has my back.
[00:36:07] >> And I think that's kind of important in
[00:36:09] any management lesson, whether it's a
[00:36:10] board, whether it's a CEO or their
[00:36:12] colleagues or whether it's whoever
[00:36:14] you're a manager, your people need to
[00:36:16] know you have their back
[00:36:18] >> because if if it's kind of like, think
[00:36:20] about it like if you're if you're
[00:36:21] hanging out of a plane and you know, if
[00:36:22] you're like doing something and
[00:36:23] somebody's else is holding the rope, you
[00:36:24] got to believe this person's going to
[00:36:25] pull me back in when things get rough.
[00:36:28] If I trust that person's gonna pull me
[00:36:30] back in and protect me, I will go flail
[00:36:32] and do whatever I need to do. So, I've
[00:36:34] always felt that when somebody's had my
[00:36:36] back, I can do well. What's the worst
[00:36:38] that could happen?
[00:36:39] >> Got it. You kind of you a bit a lot of
[00:36:41] your career, you running sales
[00:36:42] organizations.
[00:36:44] >> Funny enough, you
[00:36:45] >> or go to market orgs.
[00:36:46] >> Well, let's see. I was an analyst.
[00:36:48] >> You ran Google Europe. That was sort of
[00:36:50] go to market.
[00:36:51] >> Yeah. But it's kind of interesting. I
[00:36:52] did run Google Europe. Yeah. But when I
[00:36:55] inherited Google Europe, we were 20% of
[00:36:58] the company's revenue.
[00:36:59] >> Yeah.
[00:37:00] >> When I left, we were the largest
[00:37:02] business of Google, which is very rare
[00:37:04] for an American company to have a larger
[00:37:05] European business than US business.
[00:37:07] >> So, I had to come back here and increase
[00:37:09] the growth rate here in the US. So,
[00:37:11] >> but you don't do that by being just a
[00:37:14] goto market person. You have to run a
[00:37:17] crossf functional play because it's kind
[00:37:20] of like if the marketing is not doing
[00:37:21] well, it's impacting my business. How do
[00:37:23] I get marketing? So as the only guy go
[00:37:25] to market guy at Google who marketing
[00:37:27] reported to ever
[00:37:28] >> before me marketing reported directly to
[00:37:30] you know my boss and after me marketing
[00:37:33] reported to the reports to the CEO when
[00:37:35] I was at Google both marketing and sales
[00:37:37] reported to me so you have to be able to
[00:37:38] run a cross functional playbook if you
[00:37:40] want to be successful.
[00:37:41] >> Okay but I guess my question to you is
[00:37:44] like I look across the industry
[00:37:48] >> there's not a lot of kind of people who
[00:37:50] grew up and go to market as as if I'm
[00:37:53] grown up yet, but uh let's let's go
[00:37:56] back. I started my life
[00:37:58] >> off
[00:37:59] >> as a Bill Mcderman at Service Now. I
[00:38:02] kind of throw youish in that bucket.
[00:38:04] There's very few. Why do you think that
[00:38:06] is?
[00:38:07] >> Yeah, but I see I don't see myself as a
[00:38:09] go to market person.
[00:38:10] >> I can do go to market. I'm not a go to
[00:38:13] market person.
[00:38:14] >> Okay.
[00:38:14] >> I am
[00:38:15] >> You're an athlete.
[00:38:16] >> I spend 50% of my time in product. M
[00:38:20] >> but you grew up running big go to market
[00:38:23] orcs. You grew you did a lot of stuff.
[00:38:25] >> I did all kinds of stuff. I was a
[00:38:26] analyst. I was chief marketing officer.
[00:38:28] I was a product guy at T-Mobile.
[00:38:31] >> I I did it. I I wrote code when I
[00:38:34] started Fidelity. So I kind of like
[00:38:37] >> did a whole bunch of things badly and
[00:38:38] then eventually they decided I wasn't
[00:38:40] good at one thing. I got to do
[00:38:41] everything.
[00:38:41] >> I'm a VP at XYZ company right now.
[00:38:44] >> Yes.
[00:38:44] >> And I want to be CEO of a scaled
[00:38:47] company. I don't want to found a
[00:38:48] company. What advice do you have for me?
[00:38:51] >> Uh, get lucky.
[00:38:54] I think I'm I'm luckier than than good
[00:38:57] in some of the scenarios. But like on a
[00:38:59] more serious note in Silicon Valley,
[00:39:03] most companies which do which lose sight
[00:39:06] of a product focus over time die.
[00:39:08] >> Yeah. So that's why I'm I'm fighting you
[00:39:11] in characterizing me as a goto market
[00:39:13] person because I don't see myself as a
[00:39:15] goto market person versus other people
[00:39:16] who've named a lot of respect for Bill
[00:39:18] and Mark. They're probably the two the
[00:39:20] best sort of sales leaders in the world
[00:39:23] for the enterprise business. But
[00:39:24] >> I'm not them. I'm not as good as them at
[00:39:26] doing what they do. But I think I
[00:39:28] balance product and go to market well
[00:39:30] enough that allows us to run as a
[00:39:31] cohesive company.
[00:39:32] >> I build product half the time. The
[00:39:34] acquisitions are done by me and a bunch
[00:39:35] of people. I don't have an acquisitions
[00:39:37] team. It's me. Oh,
[00:39:38] >> I sit down with the CEOs. I look at the
[00:39:39] tech. I look at all the
[00:39:41] >> So,
[00:39:42] >> but this is something I learned at
[00:39:44] Google. Larry Page had a very clear
[00:39:45] view. Companies that don't focus on
[00:39:47] product lose sight of product. And like,
[00:39:50] you know, the the best compliment is the
[00:39:52] worst sort of compliment Larry ever gave
[00:39:54] me. Says, "Oh, no company in tech failed
[00:39:57] because of sales. You're running sales.
[00:39:59] I don't have two hours. If I had two
[00:40:01] hours, I could make you do your job
[00:40:03] better, but I have to go focus on
[00:40:04] product because that's why companies
[00:40:05] fell." So, he just told me to go away. I
[00:40:07] think it was a compliment. I think he
[00:40:08] meant I'm doing my job well, but he did
[00:40:11] say that Bill Campbell and Eric Schmidt
[00:40:12] told me, "Do your job well, so go do
[00:40:14] what you're doing and don't waste my
[00:40:15] time because I'm focusing on product."
[00:40:16] But he kind of told me to go away. And I
[00:40:18] I believe what he said like if you don't
[00:40:21] make sure you're you're obsessive,
[00:40:24] paranoid about your product, you're
[00:40:27] going to fail in the medium term and you
[00:40:28] get complacent. And look, you know, I've
[00:40:30] been there for seven years. I'm still
[00:40:32] chomping at the bit. I'm still looking
[00:40:33] at companies. I'm still meeting. I'm at
[00:40:35] three today, right? just to understand
[00:40:36] what they're working on, what's
[00:40:37] interesting. I go back and process my
[00:40:39] head, is that going to be big? Is that
[00:40:40] interesting? Is that a feature? Is that
[00:40:42] a platform of the future? Is that going
[00:40:43] to be big?
[00:40:44] >> And it's kind of interesting. There are
[00:40:46] many examples out there in even in cyber
[00:40:48] security which people have generated,
[00:40:50] you know, billions of dollars of private
[00:40:52] valuations have gone back to nothing in
[00:40:54] some cases. I think there's a few out
[00:40:56] there, but I'm constantly evaluating
[00:40:57] them, trying to analyze, will they get
[00:40:59] there, will they not be able to get
[00:41:00] there? And I think I have reasonably
[00:41:02] good hit rate in my brain in terms of
[00:41:04] what works, what doesn't work. Just back
[00:41:05] to my question. I'm I'm an upandcomer.
[00:41:08] >> Oh, okay. You want to go talk with the
[00:41:10] VP? Yes.
[00:41:10] >> Uh, and I need some advice from,
[00:41:13] you know, I'm a founder. I'm a little
[00:41:15] bit of a different animal than you, but
[00:41:16] I I want let's say I'm a upandcomer and
[00:41:18] I want to be you. Like, what what do you
[00:41:21] do? Okay. You're 30. Yeah. Well, you
[00:41:24] have to have product savvy. If you don't
[00:41:26] understand product in your industry or
[00:41:28] product in where you want to be, it's
[00:41:31] going to be hard in Silicon Valley,
[00:41:32] right? You don't need to understand
[00:41:34] product.
[00:41:36] You have to be able to sell. But at the
[00:41:38] end of the day, even my head of product
[00:41:39] sells.
[00:41:40] >> Yeah.
[00:41:40] >> Right. Because you're trying to solve a
[00:41:42] customer's problem. You can have great
[00:41:43] product vision. You can do a whole bunch
[00:41:44] of stuff. But if you're not able to
[00:41:46] sell, we don't need you. Right. So
[00:41:48] there's a combination of being able to
[00:41:49] sell and being able to build product. I
[00:41:51] think
[00:41:53] if you're any other function in a tech
[00:41:56] company, we shouldn't make you CEO,
[00:41:59] right? We shouldn't make the finance guy
[00:42:01] the CEO. We shouldn't make the marketing
[00:42:03] guy the CEO or gal. We just have to make
[00:42:05] sure you have you're a deep technologist
[00:42:08] and you can go innovate your way out of
[00:42:11] everything and we're going to be people
[00:42:12] going to be buying us whether they like
[00:42:13] us or not because we have the best
[00:42:14] innovation on the planet. Yeah.
[00:42:16] >> Or you're able to balance that
[00:42:17] innovation with good UI as in you're a
[00:42:19] good person you can sell as well. And
[00:42:21] that's I think that's the magic formula.
[00:42:23] >> Um okay you brought up Larry. You've
[00:42:26] worked for some interesting people.
[00:42:28] >> Yes.
[00:42:28] >> You work for Larry. You work for Eric.
[00:42:30] >> Yes. You work for uh
[00:42:32] >> Masa Sergey Brin.
[00:42:34] >> Yep. Is what have you taken from them?
[00:42:37] Is there a common thread that we can
[00:42:38] share?
[00:42:39] >> Uh
[00:42:42] the common thread is
[00:42:45] all of them to some degree have had high
[00:42:48] standard deviation.
[00:42:50] >> Okay. What do you mean by that?
[00:42:52] >> What I mean by that is that they're not
[00:42:54] your run-of-the-mill downthe middle
[00:42:56] people. They always have some some
[00:42:58] things that they're so focused and say
[00:43:00] good at that they ignore the other part.
[00:43:02] >> They're obsessive
[00:43:03] >> obsessive or they have focus on one
[00:43:04] thing which they can ignore the other
[00:43:06] things not worry about and somebody else
[00:43:07] takes care of it. Larry was very
[00:43:08] obsessed about product and innovation
[00:43:10] and like literally you talked to him
[00:43:12] going in there showing him a sales plan.
[00:43:13] and he wants to talk about, you know,
[00:43:15] tunnels that we can run on 101 to reduce
[00:43:17] traffic or we were flying to Spain once
[00:43:19] and he literally came with the idea of
[00:43:21] Google Maps on the plane saying, "Oh,
[00:43:22] you know, how many miles of roads are
[00:43:24] there in in the United States? Maybe
[00:43:26] instead of trying to get ctographic maps
[00:43:28] and being held to ransom by e the
[00:43:31] mapping authorities of countries, we
[00:43:33] just go ride our own cars around the
[00:43:34] streets. We'll cover them." when he was
[00:43:36] doing the math, how many cars you how
[00:43:37] many drivers he needed or how many
[00:43:39] cameras do we need to buy to go take a
[00:43:41] photo copy of every book in every
[00:43:43] library in the world.
[00:43:44] >> How about Eric?
[00:43:44] >> Eric, I think uh was spectacular for
[00:43:48] Google. I think what he did being able
[00:43:50] to get the best out of founders and put
[00:43:54] some structure around them to Eric was
[00:43:56] the best interface between two young
[00:43:58] founders who had never run a company
[00:44:01] with people who were used to structure
[00:44:03] and used to companies and he was the
[00:44:04] best kind of foil interface encourager
[00:44:08] mentor because Eric was very true to
[00:44:10] what the founders wanted. he always
[00:44:12] found a way of exposing and capturing
[00:44:16] and encapsulating what they wanted and
[00:44:18] translating to the rest of the
[00:44:19] organization. So he was amazing at I
[00:44:21] think he's the one reason one of the
[00:44:22] many reasons why Google went from being
[00:44:24] that small sort of search white paper to
[00:44:28] being effectively what is now multi-
[00:44:30] trillion dollar company. I think his
[00:44:32] incubating it was amazing and his
[00:44:34] ability to sort of take himself out of
[00:44:38] the equation in a self aacing way. Even
[00:44:41] then he has opinions and he would find a
[00:44:43] way of of
[00:44:45] sort of couching his opinions away that
[00:44:48] it would feel like the founders's idea.
[00:44:49] >> So he did a really good job I think of
[00:44:51] translating their wishes and being able
[00:44:53] to get what they wanted at the same
[00:44:54] time.
[00:44:55] >> Have you taken a lot from him in
[00:44:56] PaloAlto?
[00:44:57] >> I think so. Look, we all absorb certain
[00:45:00] behaviors from different people.
[00:45:01] >> Sounds like you absorbed a bunch of him.
[00:45:03] >> Him, Larry, Masa.
[00:45:06] >> Tell me about Masa. What' you take from
[00:45:07] him? What can we all learn from Masa?
[00:45:09] >> Look, I told you we should hit
[00:45:13] hard and, you know, hit big in the first
[00:45:16] early.
[00:45:17] >> There's no earlier than hitting big
[00:45:18] every day, right? I keep I I say that I
[00:45:21] said it before. You know, we bring up
[00:45:23] our kids and we teach them. We risk
[00:45:24] manage our kids. You know, our kids grew
[00:45:26] up saying, "Don't cross the street. Be
[00:45:27] careful. look like left, look right,
[00:45:28] don't jump at the pool without a flirty
[00:45:30] or literally constantly risk managing
[00:45:32] our children until they grow up and say,
[00:45:33] "Oh, good. My kid's a good kid." He
[00:45:35] comes home and does homework like me,
[00:45:37] you know, and doesn't get into trouble.
[00:45:38] That's risk management. Masa does not do
[00:45:40] that. Masa's the opposite. Masa says,
[00:45:43] "Okay, we can borrow more money. Okay,
[00:45:45] let's go double down on this asset.
[00:45:47] Don't worry about this one. Let's go do
[00:45:48] this one." And he's like a, you know,
[00:45:50] kid in a candy store. He will go bet big
[00:45:52] every day. And that's kind of how he
[00:45:54] operates. So his risk appetite is
[00:45:56] fundamentally different than anybody
[00:45:57] else I've met in my life.
[00:45:58] >> And that's kind of like he's kind of
[00:46:00] like that kid who falls and stands up
[00:46:02] every time takes another punch in the
[00:46:04] face because he knows one of these
[00:46:05] punches going to land not land he's
[00:46:07] going to win. My Mount Rushmore of CEOs
[00:46:10] are Steve Jobs,
[00:46:13] my dad and Jerry Garcia. Who do you
[00:46:16] follow? Do you follow like my gen I
[00:46:18] think we're similar ages like Steve Jobs
[00:46:20] was kind of the guy. The younger
[00:46:22] generation seems to follow Elon. Is
[00:46:23] there someone is there a
[00:46:25] >> you know I think
[00:46:26] >> is there someone now you're learning
[00:46:27] from or watching?
[00:46:28] >> It's kind of like this this is an
[00:46:30] interesting question. Uh I struggle to
[00:46:33] encapsulate everything I want to learn
[00:46:35] into one person.
[00:46:36] >> Okay.
[00:46:37] >> And I think if you look at some of the
[00:46:39] great CEOs out there each of them has
[00:46:43] some amazing set of attributes we can
[00:46:45] try to look at and say oh my god this
[00:46:46] person's crazy. I mean look at Leon like
[00:46:48] you know he's the most innovative person
[00:46:49] in the world. Now,
[00:46:50] >> there are certain things I wouldn't want
[00:46:51] to
[00:46:53] >> sort of take from him, but his ability
[00:46:55] to think out of the box, his ability to
[00:46:57] think big, his ability to go solve a
[00:46:59] really hard problem. And as he's proving
[00:47:01] that, look, you solve a really hard
[00:47:02] problem, you go at it for 5, seven,
[00:47:04] eight years. You find the resources,
[00:47:05] you're everybody else 8 years behind.
[00:47:07] Now, the question is, can you capitalize
[00:47:08] on that, monetize that? Look at whether
[00:47:10] it's a car, whether it's Starlink,
[00:47:11] whether it's Neuralink, whe I don't
[00:47:12] know, you saw a company yesterday that
[00:47:14] he's launched, which is called Macro
[00:47:15] hard. It's be interesting. I don't know
[00:47:16] quite know what it does but so his
[00:47:18] ability to just think so far ahead and
[00:47:20] try and go after meaty big problems very
[00:47:22] fundamentally different than half the
[00:47:24] founders show up saying I've got an app
[00:47:26] which optimizes your sales flow dude how
[00:47:28] many more of those do I need
[00:47:29] >> right so I think watching him think
[00:47:31] about trying to be a true entrepreneur I
[00:47:34] think it's bar none right you just named
[00:47:36] Bill Mcderman and Mark Penny I think
[00:47:38] they're the two best enterprise sales
[00:47:40] evangelists in the world I mean you can
[00:47:41] learn from them because they know how to
[00:47:43] go take something turn to a platform how
[00:47:46] work the system, how to build go to
[00:47:47] market, how to lead their teams to
[00:47:49] greatness, right? I mean, look at the
[00:47:51] other side. There are some amazing
[00:47:52] founders. I was with Ali last week.
[00:47:54] I think he's amazing. He's doing a
[00:47:55] phenomenal job at data bricks. He's
[00:47:57] hard-nosed. He knows what he wants. He's
[00:47:59] grinding it out and he's building
[00:48:00] something that's going Sam Alman. Nobody
[00:48:02] in their right mind
[00:48:05] can imagine what he's up to, right?
[00:48:06] Like, two and a half years ago, he just
[00:48:08] launched at GPT. Today, we've got
[00:48:10] hundred billion dollar deals. I mean,
[00:48:11] these are big deals by any imagination.
[00:48:14] like and you do three in a row in a span
[00:48:16] of four weeks or 6 weeks. There's people
[00:48:19] out there doing big gutsy meaningful
[00:48:22] meaty stuff. Some of this still remains
[00:48:23] to be seen where it's going to land. But
[00:48:25] it's just is there a common thread,
[00:48:28] >> appetite for risk.
[00:48:30] >> They're all very different. Was when you
[00:48:32] went through them like they're all very
[00:48:34] different.
[00:48:34] >> Very different. They're all very
[00:48:35] different. And I think uh that's the
[00:48:37] beauty of
[00:48:38] >> yourself. Everyone else is taken.
[00:48:40] You know, it's kind of like you're very
[00:48:42] right in the way you say that if you're
[00:48:44] not yourself, the risk is you're going
[00:48:47] to do a shitty job of trying to be
[00:48:48] somebody else. So, you might as well
[00:48:50] keep doing a good job of being yourself.
[00:48:51] And if that works out, it's good.
[00:48:53] >> When I was CEO of HubSpot,
[00:48:56] I had this ratio of the average HubSpot
[00:48:59] employee was X, and I didn't want to be
[00:49:01] more than 30x off.
[00:49:03] >> Why was I wrong about that?
[00:49:04] >> 30x of what?
[00:49:06] >> The average. So, if the average Hub
[00:49:08] spotter was making huh,
[00:49:10] >> you know, 100,000 bucks, I didn't want
[00:49:12] to be more than 30x. You're one of the
[00:49:14] best paid CEOs in history. Tell me your
[00:49:17] philosophy on pay.
[00:49:18] >> Well, actually, you know, funny you
[00:49:20] should, and I've never talked about this
[00:49:22] publicly, but I didn't set out to be
[00:49:25] Yeah. that when I met the board of Palo
[00:49:29] Alto, I said, "Listen, you pay your CEO
[00:49:32] 20 million bucks a year. I plan to be
[00:49:34] here for seven years. just give me seven
[00:49:36] years worth of stock now and you can
[00:49:39] take it away if I leave sooner at any
[00:49:41] point in time. That's the only thing I
[00:49:42] said.
[00:49:42] >> It was a seven-year vest.
[00:49:44] >> Yeah, it was a seven-year vest. I see.
[00:49:45] >> And it's 20 million bucks here, which
[00:49:46] what they paid Mark.
[00:49:47] >> So, I didn't ask for any more than what
[00:49:48] they were paying Mark. I did add a
[00:49:50] twist. I said, "Listen, I don't need
[00:49:51] money. Why don't do it all in options?"
[00:49:54] >> They got cold feet. They gave me half in
[00:49:55] options. Those half options turned out
[00:49:57] to,
[00:49:58] >> you know, tremendous amount of money
[00:50:00] because of the fact the stock moved up
[00:50:01] six times. I set out to be exactly what
[00:50:03] they were paying somebody else relative
[00:50:05] to the benchmarks in the market.
[00:50:06] >> That's how you did it. Um, you're
[00:50:09] advising a CEO today.
[00:50:13] Uh, how should they think about comp?
[00:50:15] Like should they be doing it like Elon?
[00:50:17] Like you really pay a lot for great
[00:50:20] performance. You don't pay that much for
[00:50:22] mediocre performance. Should you be
[00:50:25] heavy on ISOs versus nonquals versus
[00:50:28] PSUs?
[00:50:29] uh should you have long vests, short
[00:50:31] vests like
[00:50:32] >> I think the you're advising a board, you
[00:50:34] know,
[00:50:34] >> the balanced approach is that you have
[00:50:38] to have enough on the table that the CEO
[00:50:42] or the employee for that matter doesn't
[00:50:44] feel like they can leave and go if
[00:50:46] things don't work out.
[00:50:47] >> Yeah.
[00:50:47] >> You want enough skin in the game that
[00:50:50] even in a reasonable scenario, I'm going
[00:50:53] to make a reasonable amount of money so
[00:50:54] I don't feel I need to go somewhere
[00:50:55] else. Yeah. At the same time, there
[00:50:57] should be adequate reward for hitting a
[00:51:00] home run. I think that's the balance
[00:51:02] boards need to strike. There's lots of
[00:51:03] models out there in terms of how it's
[00:51:05] done. There's a combination of RSUs and
[00:51:07] PSUs that people do. There are threeear
[00:51:10] vests people do. There are cumulative
[00:51:12] vests. There's stock price. So, there's
[00:51:13] many different tools in the toolkit to
[00:51:15] make it happen. I think that's not
[00:51:18] that's not kind of where
[00:51:20] it actually matters.
[00:51:22] >> Okay. I think where it matters is
[00:51:26] and this I've seen this many times
[00:51:27] because obviously my packages are public
[00:51:29] and I've had many CEOs call and say how
[00:51:31] do you structure this? The CEOs actually
[00:51:33] have to have a conviction of what they
[00:51:35] believe the business is capable of.
[00:51:37] >> Right? Elon just didn't go ask for a
[00:51:38] package. He actually said I believe I
[00:51:40] can do this to the business. He actually
[00:51:41] achieved that and then he got in trouble
[00:51:43] because it wasn't fully done the right
[00:51:44] way. But he had a conviction. Many of
[00:51:46] the people who have taken packages like
[00:51:48] Elon haven't failed as well because they
[00:51:50] didn't get there. So you have to have a
[00:51:52] very reasonable sense of
[00:51:55] >> scenario planning. How can my business
[00:51:57] get there? I can tell you high power
[00:51:59] altar can go from now what is $140
[00:52:01] billion company to half a trillion
[00:52:02] dollar company in 10 years if certain
[00:52:04] things work out right. I have a view as
[00:52:05] to how to get there.
[00:52:07] >> I know the math to get there and the
[00:52:08] question can I execute to the math.
[00:52:10] >> If you have a math you can execute to
[00:52:12] the math you'll get there. But I've seen
[00:52:14] CEOs who say oh my math is because I'm a
[00:52:16] you know thinly traded stock at 5%. I
[00:52:18] just went public. I think I can triple
[00:52:19] the frame. But that thing can go down as
[00:52:21] quickly as it goes up and it's fully
[00:52:22] 100% public. Go do the math. So I think
[00:52:25] many people don't do the math of what
[00:52:28] the feasible set of outcomes is and what
[00:52:30] the probability associated with them is.
[00:52:32] Once you do the math, understand the
[00:52:33] probabilities, then you can go take
[00:52:34] whatever.
[00:52:34] >> I think the thing that's broken out of
[00:52:36] it is like most public companies, they
[00:52:37] look at your comps. Yes.
[00:52:39] >> Similar market size companies. Then
[00:52:41] every public company says we're going to
[00:52:42] the comps and we're going to pay you at
[00:52:43] the 75th percentile. And
[00:52:46] >> but after five years the 70% moved up
[00:52:48] because everybody's now that's 50th
[00:52:49] percentile.
[00:52:50] >> Absolutely.
[00:52:52] >> Don't tell everybody that.
[00:52:53] >> Yes. Um okay, last question.
[00:52:57] >> Yes, sir.
[00:52:57] >> You've got a very in I don't know you
[00:52:59] well, but my sense from talking to Jim
[00:53:01] and others, you have a very vibrant,
[00:53:04] interesting life outside the
[00:53:06] spreadsheet.
[00:53:07] >> Um and I'm just going to rattle a few
[00:53:09] things off that I know about and I know
[00:53:10] there's a lot more. You purchased a
[00:53:12] cricket team.
[00:53:13] >> Yes. Uh, you won the MX ProAm golf
[00:53:17] tournament pretty recently.
[00:53:18] >> Blind squirrel Theory finds an acorn.
[00:53:21] >> Yep. Um,
[00:53:23] you married what seems like an amazing
[00:53:26] woman from an amazing family, had an
[00:53:28] amazing wedding ceremony.
[00:53:29] >> Yes.
[00:53:30] >> And it kind of goes on and on. Most of
[00:53:32] the CEOs I work with are pretty obsessed
[00:53:35] with work and don't really have much of
[00:53:37] a vibrant life outside. particularly now
[00:53:40] like it seems like people are kind of
[00:53:42] following the Elon playbook and the 996
[00:53:45] um playbook. Tell me about your life and
[00:53:48] how how you think about it. Give me give
[00:53:50] me some advice.
[00:53:51] >> Oh, look um when I turned 40,
[00:53:55] I invited 40 of my friends uh for my
[00:53:58] 40th birthday. I took them away and we
[00:54:00] had a great time.
[00:54:01] >> How old are you now?
[00:54:02] >> I'm 57. It's public, so there's no harm
[00:54:04] talking about it.
[00:54:05] >> I'm the same.
[00:54:06] >> Okay. So, um, and
[00:54:09] I had I actually spoke about every one
[00:54:11] of the 40 people who were there at my
[00:54:14] 40th birthday. And I found that amazing.
[00:54:16] And I said, I hope I can do that when
[00:54:18] I'm 50 and I can do that when I'm 60.
[00:54:20] >> And it's kind of like
[00:54:23] you can't do that if you don't invest in
[00:54:24] them. So, I like to invest in my
[00:54:27] friendships. I spend time with my
[00:54:28] friends. I check on them. They check on
[00:54:30] me. They know I'm there for them. So,
[00:54:32] that takes up a reasonable part of my
[00:54:34] life. I have three amazing kids. Uh
[00:54:37] >> making sure they get my attention. My
[00:54:38] wife
[00:54:39] >> I met one of your kids at the airport.
[00:54:40] >> Yes, you did. You did. Yes, you did. And
[00:54:42] I have two others. Uh you have met, but
[00:54:44] all three of them are amazing and I want
[00:54:46] to be able to spend time with them. I
[00:54:48] also promise myself I try I try I can't
[00:54:53] say I'm 100% on this. I try not to do
[00:54:55] dinners. I don't do work dinners. Oh,
[00:54:58] >> which is hard because a lot of people
[00:55:00] want to do work dinners. But in a
[00:55:02] sitting and talking business after
[00:55:03] having worked the whole day is not my
[00:55:05] cup of tea. Now once in a while I get
[00:55:07] >> you have to do them. I was last night I
[00:55:08] went and spoke to 12 CEOs who were at my
[00:55:10] wife's restaurant. So I had to go do
[00:55:11] that but I asked her to come join me
[00:55:12] afterwards at dinner with her. So I
[00:55:14] would always try and find a way and by
[00:55:16] the way this is not just there at Google
[00:55:18] I it was a rule and if you work to
[00:55:20] Google in marketing every event for
[00:55:22] customers would have to have with
[00:55:23] spouses so I could bring my spouse to
[00:55:25] dinner.
[00:55:26] >> Okay. So, I find a way of making sure
[00:55:28] I'm not without my family at dinners. I
[00:55:30] try to do that. I kind of have a rule
[00:55:33] that I try not to work weekends.
[00:55:34] >> Okay.
[00:55:35] >> Which is hard, which I still do about 2
[00:55:38] three hours a weekend, but I I I want to
[00:55:40] work my 60 hours between
[00:55:43] >> 7 is that is it about 60 hours you
[00:55:46] figure you work?
[00:55:46] >> I think so. I think so. Now, my wife
[00:55:48] will tell you that probably my brain
[00:55:50] works way longer than that, 60 hours.
[00:55:51] And you know she always sort of
[00:55:54] questions me why did I join two
[00:55:55] different boards in addition to Palo
[00:55:56] Alto I'm on the board of Uber and
[00:55:58] Rishamont but you know it keeps me
[00:55:59] intellectually honest I see other
[00:56:01] business.
[00:56:01] >> What's your day like? So what was tell
[00:56:03] me about today?
[00:56:05] >> What time did you get up?
[00:56:06] >> I woke up at 5:30.
[00:56:08] >> Why?
[00:56:09] >> I go to the gym at 6. I watch CNBC for a
[00:56:12] little bit.
[00:56:13] >> Okay.
[00:56:13] >> I unwind. I
[00:56:14] >> CNBC is doesn't unwind me.
[00:56:16] >> Well I watch it to see what's going on
[00:56:18] in the world so I can kind of keep track
[00:56:20] of what's going on. I usually go to the
[00:56:22] gym. I'll go invert myself for five or
[00:56:24] six minutes. I'll do a little bit of
[00:56:26] weights. I'll do a little bit of
[00:56:27] stretching. I go to the get myself
[00:56:29] stretched, etc. Work my way back to my
[00:56:32] kids at 7:00. They wake up at around
[00:56:34] seven. They're young and chat with them
[00:56:37] a little bit.
[00:56:37] >> Yeah.
[00:56:38] >> Then I came to work at 8:30.
[00:56:40] >> Okay.
[00:56:41] >> And I talk to three different customers.
[00:56:43] I talked to two startups. I
[00:56:45] >> In the day, is it you booked every half
[00:56:46] hour? You have big openings. You have
[00:56:48] time to think. Do you
[00:56:49] >> I usually am booked every half hour.
[00:56:51] Sometimes it's an hour. I usually have a
[00:56:54] half an hour gap here or there to just
[00:56:56] >> you get exhausted during the day ever or
[00:56:57] you just up.
[00:56:58] >> No, I can power through the days pretty.
[00:57:01] Look, my superpower is uh context
[00:57:03] switching and being able to focus.
[00:57:05] >> I think that's a key thing.
[00:57:06] >> Yes.
[00:57:07] >> Yeah.
[00:57:07] >> I'm the best consumer of slides or
[00:57:09] PowerPoint than you can find. I can
[00:57:10] Okay. I can absorb 20 in under a minute
[00:57:13] and tell you what the problem is.
[00:57:14] >> Oh, that's a pattern recognition.
[00:57:16] >> That's a superpower.
[00:57:16] >> It's pattern recognition. Yes. Um, lots
[00:57:19] of inputs coming into you like millions
[00:57:22] of freaking emails and Slacks and texts
[00:57:24] and phone calls and requests for your
[00:57:26] time. How do you manage the just the
[00:57:28] hurricane of chaos? Good news is unless
[00:57:30] it's a customer email,
[00:57:33] you can ignore it.
[00:57:34] >> Okay. Unless somebody really needs
[00:57:36] something for you, you can ignore most
[00:57:37] of them. Half the inbox is full of junk.
[00:57:40] >> Yeah.
[00:57:41] >> Um, probably 10 20% is people telling me
[00:57:44] what's going on. and I'll read through
[00:57:45] them and I kind of get the gist of it.
[00:57:47] >> If it's a customer will not respond.
[00:57:50] >> I did learn a trick which I do in my
[00:57:52] personal inbox because my personal email
[00:57:54] is a lot less,
[00:57:55] >> you know, noise in them. Every time I've
[00:57:58] action an email or I don't need it, I
[00:58:01] will either archive it or delete it or
[00:58:03] file it.
[00:58:03] >> Okay.
[00:58:04] >> So, my personal inbox is always less
[00:58:06] than 100 emails.
[00:58:07] >> Your inbox zeroish?
[00:58:10] >> 100 emails is pretty good. And usually
[00:58:12] I'll go review it once in a while and
[00:58:13] some of them will go in. and I'll action
[00:58:15] them because that I keep pretty
[00:58:17] >> well managed and the work one I do it
[00:58:20] right then if I don't right then there's
[00:58:21] a risk that it slips
[00:58:22] >> what advice do you have to the founders
[00:58:23] who are really committed to 996 and
[00:58:25] their teams on 96
[00:58:26] >> what is 996
[00:58:27] >> 996 is uh they but they require of
[00:58:30] themselves
[00:58:31] >> like a new Porsche or something
[00:58:32] >> no no it's they they require everyone to
[00:58:34] work 9 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. six days a week
[00:58:36] in the in the office.
[00:58:38] That's kind of in fashion with the
[00:58:40] startups now and it's most of them.
[00:58:43] >> Yeah. I I think there is tremendous
[00:58:46] amounts of impatience out there because
[00:58:48] people somehow believe that every minute
[00:58:51] that they're not trying to further their
[00:58:52] objective. They're going to not win. And
[00:58:56] I think that's a fallacy.
[00:58:58] >> I think some amazing businesses have
[00:58:59] been built because their idea was so
[00:59:01] different. I don't think people have
[00:59:03] outco competed Starlink even if they
[00:59:05] weren't working nice even though Elon
[00:59:07] does for the most part because he's
[00:59:08] trying to get somewhere. He's got six
[00:59:09] different companies to manage. But I
[00:59:11] just think working smarter might be
[00:59:13] better in balance
[00:59:15] >> than working hard. You run the risk of
[00:59:17] burning out. You run the risk of burning
[00:59:18] people out.
[00:59:19] >> Yeah.
[00:59:19] >> I I I don't see the value of 99.
[00:59:23] >> I appreciate you coming on the pod.
[00:59:24] You're kind of the Renaissance CEO. Uh I
[00:59:27] just came back from Florence and you're
[00:59:29] kind of a Renaissance man CEO. So, I
[00:59:31] appreciate you coming on.
[00:59:33] >> Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.
[00:59:34] >> Thank you very much.
[00:59:36] >> Okay, hopefully you like that episode
[00:59:38] with Nikesh. He's terrific. You probably
[00:59:40] noticed we talked a lot about M&A. It
[00:59:41] was a little self- serving because
[00:59:42] HubSpot's done a bunch of M&A and I
[00:59:44] wanted to learn from him. He's done a
[00:59:45] ton of it and it's largely worked. But
[00:59:47] what I wanted to do for you guys is to
[00:59:49] kind of turn it around and and use what
[00:59:52] he said as like what would I do as a
[00:59:55] founder thinking about selling my
[00:59:57] company or getting interest in selling
[00:59:58] my company? How might I think about
[01:00:00] that? And how might I negotiate with
[01:00:02] someone for example like Nesh? Now first
[01:00:05] there are several reasons you might
[01:00:07] consider selling. Um one is if you've
[01:00:11] got a big platform player like Palo Alto
[01:00:13] or Salesforce or whoever it would be and
[01:00:15] they come knocking and you pass on them,
[01:00:18] there's a decent chance they buy your
[01:00:20] competitor. And if they don't do that,
[01:00:23] there's a decent chance they build it
[01:00:24] themselves. It's going to take him a
[01:00:25] while, but that big platform player
[01:00:27] could be hard to deal with down the
[01:00:29] road. And you know, one of my things is
[01:00:31] either either you become a platform or
[01:00:33] you get eaten by a platform. And that
[01:00:35] could easily happen to you. And so don't
[01:00:38] underestimate that. The other thing he
[01:00:39] said on the call that was interesting is
[01:00:41] if a sales rep selling his product and
[01:00:43] it's a platform, there's 10 different
[01:00:45] products on top of that platform, that
[01:00:47] 11th product, yours,
[01:00:50] PaloAlto doesn't need to be out innovate
[01:00:52] you. It doesn't need to be beyond you in
[01:00:54] terms of features and functions. It
[01:00:55] needs to be a table stakes and the buyer
[01:00:57] will want to continue to buy from that
[01:00:59] platform vendor. And so don't
[01:01:00] underestimate if you pass on it the
[01:01:02] trouble that could come down the road.
[01:01:04] Um the second obvious reason is you make
[01:01:06] a ton of money, sell the company. Um and
[01:01:09] if you're young, you can put that money
[01:01:11] to work and start another company. Um
[01:01:13] I'm old. Uh and the third really nice
[01:01:18] thing about selling your company is you
[01:01:20] get massive distribution for your
[01:01:22] invention. You invented this amazing
[01:01:23] thing. You're working on distribution.
[01:01:25] You're probably not enjoying that and
[01:01:27] you can get huge distribution from the
[01:01:29] platform better. And that certainly
[01:01:30] happens with Palo Alto. So those are
[01:01:31] kind of the reasons to do it. So let's
[01:01:34] say you're thinking about doing it. I
[01:01:36] think a mistake a lot of founders make
[01:01:38] is they overthink the headline number
[01:01:40] like we got bought for five billion
[01:01:43] whatever the number is. And if you look
[01:01:46] at it from Nikesh's side, there's other
[01:01:49] things you can negotiate other than the
[01:01:50] headline price. So let's dig into if I
[01:01:53] were negotiating with somebody to get
[01:01:55] acquired, some of the things I might
[01:01:57] want to do. First thing he said that was
[01:01:59] interesting is typically when they buy a
[01:02:02] co-founding team, one wants to stick
[01:02:03] around and the other doesn't. And I
[01:02:06] found kind of the same thing when we
[01:02:07] acquire companies inside of HubSpot. So
[01:02:09] maybe one thing you negotiate is there's
[01:02:11] one comp plan for you if you want to
[01:02:12] stick around or one comp plan for your
[01:02:15] for your co-founder or one vesting
[01:02:16] schedule for that one that wants to get
[01:02:18] out. No matter where you are on that, I
[01:02:20] think you want different terms. Um that
[01:02:23] might be one you want to work on. The
[01:02:25] other thing he said that's kind of
[01:02:26] interesting is when he buys a company,
[01:02:28] he typically rolls back some of your
[01:02:30] shares and gives you a three-year vest
[01:02:33] on them, which is a little harsh, but
[01:02:34] everyone kind of does it. But what he
[01:02:37] said on top of that was he typically
[01:02:38] sticks a bunch of new options on top of
[01:02:40] you from PaloAlto Network up to 30%. So
[01:02:43] that's definitely something you can
[01:02:45] negotiate. He also said it's very hard
[01:02:47] to give massive grants to somebody
[01:02:49] during the normal board cycle. This is
[01:02:52] the time he can kind of get away with
[01:02:53] it. So, you might think about that if
[01:02:55] you're getting acquired. Um, you also
[01:02:58] want to think about the position. Like
[01:02:59] most companies when they acquire you,
[01:03:01] you get knocked a few levels down in
[01:03:04] that ORC chart. I like the way he
[01:03:06] thought about it. Like, hey, we were
[01:03:07] trying to get into the space. You guys
[01:03:09] were crushing us. We're going to put you
[01:03:11] you on top of our team. You might try to
[01:03:13] negotiate that. Um, I think would be a
[01:03:16] very nice thing to do. And the last
[01:03:18] thing you said that was brilliant that
[01:03:19] that I want to start doing at HubSpot is
[01:03:22] during the diligence process, you
[01:03:24] basically envision what the road map
[01:03:26] will look together so there's no big
[01:03:27] surprises, but during that you might
[01:03:29] come up with some really good ideas that
[01:03:30] make you more excited about it. Those
[01:03:32] are some of the tricks. So the headline
[01:03:34] number is important. It's good for your
[01:03:35] ego, but there's a bunch of other
[01:03:37] important things that you want to
[01:03:38] negotiate when you're going through the
[01:03:40] due diligence with someone. Okay. One of
[01:03:42] the things I really like about Manesh is
[01:03:43] is he's he unlike I was, he's very
[01:03:46] focused on work life balance. He works
[01:03:48] Monday through Friday. Um, he tries to
[01:03:52] work 60 hours a week and he doesn't do
[01:03:54] business dinners. I think that's a
[01:03:55] pretty good hack. I I do a lot of
[01:03:57] business dinners that I could I don't
[01:03:59] need to. I wonder for myself and I
[01:04:02] wonder for you if you took Nikesha's
[01:04:05] approach like would your company split
[01:04:07] in two and fall apart or maybe would the
[01:04:10] company be better off? Would you give a
[01:04:12] little room for your brain away from the
[01:04:14] company and the day-to-day tactics to
[01:04:16] really think and concentrate? He talked
[01:04:19] a little bit about luck and I feel like
[01:04:21] I've been very lucky and I want to wish
[01:04:23] you the best of luck on your CEO journey
[01:04:26] and I'll see you on the next edition of
[01:04:29] the long strange trip.
