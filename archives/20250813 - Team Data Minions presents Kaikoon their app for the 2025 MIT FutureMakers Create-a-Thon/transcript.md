[00:00:00] Good afternoon everyone. We're team nine, the 
data minions, and our theme is physical health  
[00:00:04] and mental well-being management. Today we are 
presenting tycoon microeps mighty breakthroughs.  
[00:00:10] We're a passionate team of six dedicated to 
empowering neurodeiverse teens using AI. We also  
[00:00:15] have two members who are neurodeiverse individuals 
themselves. We'd also like to thank our incredible  
[00:00:20] mentor Abraham Batista Castillo and extend a huge 
shout out to the start team and MIT Race team for  
[00:00:26] their unwavering support. One in six US teens, 
over 7 million young people are neurodeiverse,  
[00:00:33] meaning they naturally think and learn 
differently. Examples including autism,  
[00:00:37] ADHD, and dyslexia. So why does this matter? 
Well, first, neurodeiverse teens face executive  
[00:00:43] functioning challenges. Think of these as the 
brain's traffic control for planning, memory,  
[00:00:48] self-control, and flexibility. Second, without 
the tools to scaffold these skills, they often  
[00:00:53] underperform in school, which breeds self-doubt 
and helplessness. Third, those emotions erode  
[00:00:58] routines and can spiral into self- neglect, making 
even small tasks feel impossible. In other words,  
[00:01:04] when executive functioning falters, everything 
else follows. That's the gap that Coyon is  
[00:01:09] designed to fill. Our problem is clear. How do we 
transform that mountain of tasks into manageable  
[00:01:14] micro steps that spark confidence? Well, 
here's what we found from our pre-ervey. Based  
[00:01:20] on the word clouds, the most common words in our 
interviews responses include struggle, schedule,  
[00:01:24] minors, and reward. Our interviews underline our 
subjective problem in their own voices. One quote  
[00:01:29] being, "I get so overwhelmed I don't do anything 
at all. I become paralyzed." While the other quote  
[00:01:34] highlights the issue of keeping a consistent 
schedule and and struggling with focusing.  
[00:01:39] Neurodiverse teens often face challenges with with 
executive functioning such as staying focused,  
[00:01:44] managing feeling overwhelmed, and sticking to a 
schedule. This can lead to forgotten materials and  
[00:01:49] giving up on homework halfway through. Kaikoon 
solves this by breaking tasks into simple,  
[00:01:53] clear steps and adding rewards, turning each 
assignment into a motivating mini mission. Now,  
[00:01:59] onto our app component demo. Our end user focus 
guided every decision in building Kycoon. From  
[00:02:07] grade based onboarding to customized phone 
notifications. At its core, Kycoon breaks  
[00:02:12] each big, scary task into bite-sized steps using 
GPT40, then scaffolds these steps with a clear  
[00:02:19] checklist and timer. We also have a journaling 
alternative where tasks, obstacles, and deadlines  
[00:02:26] can be extracted from the entries through our 
fine-tuned spacy model. After each micro step,  
[00:02:32] users share a quick emoji reflection. Behind the 
scenes, our sentiment analysis pipeline Roberta  
[00:02:40] maps reflections to positive, neutral, or negative 
tags, triggering personalized encouragement or  
[00:02:46] next step tips. Each completed task earns Kybloom 
currency, a gentle, non-competitive gamification  
[00:02:53] point system that celebrates progress without buys 
or pressure. The following is our app demo. Users  
[00:03:01] first sign up by entering their email, display 
name, and password. Once done, users are taken  
[00:03:07] to a onboarding system where they select their 
grade and the classes to tailor the experience for  
[00:03:12] neurodyiverse teens focused on schoolwork. Then it 
lands them on the dashboard where they can click  
[00:03:17] on the plus button and enter a task. For example, 
here the user wants to do their math homework. And  
[00:03:23] then they can estimate how long this assignment 
might take them. Here the user thinks, well,  
[00:03:28] it would take them around 35 minutes. After then, 
our chat GPT API plug-in immediately breaks the  
[00:03:34] task into digestible micro steps with materials 
listed as well. Once they're done ensuring all  
[00:03:41] the materials are accurate, they can enter the 
task to the task cart where they can start a  
[00:03:45] stopwatch and go through the micro steps as they 
work. They can pause the timer once they're done.  
[00:03:50] Upon completion, an emoji like heart scale and 
a text prompt is given where users can enter  
[00:03:55] how they felt while doing the assignment and the 
Robera analysis will give a sentiment analysis.  
[00:04:00] After users can go to the reflection history 
to find their past entries. Here the user has  
[00:04:05] around 550 Kylum coins where they can shop at 
our collectibles and they can show off these  
[00:04:11] amazing badges in their garden. In the settings, 
the users can go down and enable notifications.  
[00:04:18] Another feature we have is Kybe where they can 
link a Spotify playlist if they'd like. We also  
[00:04:22] have accessibility and data management where users 
can clear their past history logs. Another feature  
[00:04:29] we have last but not least is a gen journal 
and task analysis where users can enter how  
[00:04:33] they feel. Here the user says the week was really 
exhausting. They can't seem to find the motivation  
[00:04:38] to start and they hope that they can get their 
assignment done on time. And automatically,  
[00:04:42] our spacey fine-tuned model will give the task 
found and find the obstacles identified and will  
[00:04:48] suggest a schedule for the user. And once again, 
once done, the user can go ahead and go through  
[00:04:53] the checklist. Moving on, this checklist shows 
where Kyon uniquely fits in the market. Kyon  
[00:04:59] incorporates unique features such as AIdriven 
task breakdowns, visual checklist and timers,  
[00:05:03] sentiment reflections, and the Kyboom reward 
system. Compared to competitors such as Teemo,  
[00:05:07] goblin tools and finch, Teemo has visual routines 
but has no AI or sentiment features. Goblin tool  
[00:05:12] incorporates task splitting but no emo emotional 
feedback or structure rewards. And Finch has moo  
[00:05:16] tracking but no reward system or time support. 
In short, no other solution brings together  
[00:05:20] executive function support, emotional check-ins 
and gamify motivation under one roof like Kyon.  
[00:05:27] And this is our ethical AI matrix which shows 
how Kyon supports both neurodeiverse teens and  
[00:05:31] their caregivers amongst three pillars. 
Well-being, autonomy, and fairness. For  
[00:05:35] well-being, there are structured breaks, focus 
playlist, and task breakdowns. For autonomy,  
[00:05:39] users have control over notifications, tasks, 
and customizable settings. And fairness,  
[00:05:43] there is non-competitive awards, 
strict privacy, and inclusiveness.
[00:05:48] So for future steps, we first plan to build 
burnout alerts, which use predictive analytics  
[00:05:53] to monitor timer patterns and sentiment 
logs, identifying early signs of fatigue,  
[00:05:58] and recommending personalized recovery 
actions. the adaptive reminder engine,  
[00:06:01] which leverages machine learning to 
customize break and celebration schedules,  
[00:06:05] adapting to each teen's unique work rhythm 
for optimal balance. And last but not least,  
[00:06:09] the parent and education educator portals, which 
provide secure readonly dashboards, allowing  
[00:06:15] caregivers and teachers to monitor progress while 
preserving the teens autonom autonomy and privacy.  
[00:06:21] We also have a prospective sponsor, ArtFlow, which 
is a nonprofit that supports neurodeiverse and  
[00:06:26] underserved youth through inclusive art programs 
and advocacy. They reside in over 214 schools  
[00:06:32] across six countries and 14 cities. We've already 
begun getting feedback from our interviewees on  
[00:06:38] Kyon. Here's a short clip from one of itself. It 
has helped me to put down what I need to do and  
[00:06:47] like set a time for another thing to help you 
focus on that certain task for that set amount  
[00:06:53] of time so you don't feel as overwhelmed as maybe 
you would if you didn't have it. So, in closing,  
[00:07:01] Tycoon is a movement to empower your diverse 
teams with the micro steps they need to conquer  
[00:07:04] big challenges. Thank you so much for listening 
and now we will open the floor for questions.
[00:07:29] Well, I want to say that was a fantastic 
presentation to the point I don't have a  
[00:07:33] ton of questions because you answered uh most 
of the questions I had as you went through. So,  
[00:07:37] amazing job on being very uh thorough and clear. 
Um but I I think I'd just bring back the question  
[00:07:42] actually at the first group around you know 
accessibility and thinking about the because  
[00:07:46] you're intentionally targeting that neurodeiverse 
learners like how are you thinking in your future  
[00:07:50] build not only um greater product features 
to enhance the product and make it more  
[00:07:56] uh just helpful for all students but thinking 
about the different types of students that  
[00:08:00] you are going to work with with them being 
neurotypical. Are there any considerations  
[00:08:03] you guys have in mind? Yes. So um thank you so 
much for the question. Um, Kycoon is specifically  
[00:08:10] tailored to student tasks such as completing 
homework assignments or arranging meetings or  
[00:08:15] getting ready in the morning. Um, if you give it 
tasks such as cooking a meal, for example, um,  
[00:08:18] it would not perform to the same aptitude um, as 
it would a student related question. Additionally,  
[00:08:23] the model is fed the information from the 
onboarding process at the beginning um, where  
[00:08:27] you can input your grade and your classes that you 
take. So, Kyon can shift its focus to those areas  
[00:08:34] um, even suggesting assignments such as complete 
math homework before you enter the task. So yeah.
[00:08:43] Yeah, great presentation. Uh, it made me reflect 
on how I like plan my tasks and or organize my  
[00:08:49] day. So, one thought I had when I was looking at 
your video was some of the setup required to use  
[00:08:55] your app, for example, like remembering even 
to enter a task and being able to estimate how  
[00:09:01] much time it would take. That's really hard for 
anyone to do. So what have you thought about in  
[00:09:06] terms of like supporting that initial step? Um 
can I take this question as well? Thank you so  
[00:09:13] much for the question again. Um so basically 
Kyon keeps user engagement by gamifying the  
[00:09:19] experience and their tasks. Um and it also uses 
the garden and the kybloom system. And our app  
[00:09:24] also sends notifications to the user to remind 
them to check in and add any um tasks set for  
[00:09:29] the day. um as well as reminds them of any 
tasks set in the past from journal entries.  
[00:09:34] The notifications are also customizable um meaning 
the users can tailor when and where notifications  
[00:09:39] from Kyon pop up. So for example, you can set 
a notification for every morning at 9:00 a.m.  
[00:09:44] I want to check into Kyon and put in some tasks 
I need to do for the day. Um, in the future we  
[00:09:50] hope to implement some streak systems so that can 
be added to your home screen as a widget so the  
[00:09:56] users can be reminded of your tasks and tycoon as 
a daily as a part of their daily lives. So yeah,  
[00:10:03] and I'd like to add a quick um aside uh uh comment 
on what Kona said. So currently Kai [ __ ] also  
[00:10:10] has a feature where users can just journal. 
They can just sit down and journal how their  
[00:10:14] week's been going and any upcoming tasks that 
they have for that week. And our spacey model  
[00:10:19] which we finetuned with training it will actually 
identify all the tasks that the user put in the  
[00:10:25] journal. So it's not like the user has to manually 
you know write down what like specific task it is.  
[00:10:31] they can just sit down and you know write vent 
into the journal and it'll give like obstacles  
[00:10:35] identified that the user was facing that week such 
as maybe environment issu is issues or focusing  
[00:10:40] issues and it really gives a tailored response 
to the user so they know exactly what probably  
[00:10:46] went wrong and how they can sit down and work and 
furthermore definitely in the future I think Kona  
[00:10:51] already mentioned this that we actually have four 
different notification systems one for like after  
[00:10:56] user finishes a task one to like remind a user to 
take breaks and we'd love to expand upon on this  
[00:11:01] notification system to, you know, maybe remind 
users to log in to Kyon for that day, enter maybe  
[00:11:07] more tasks and maybe even like a speech to text. 
And we'd love to grow um more on that aspect.
