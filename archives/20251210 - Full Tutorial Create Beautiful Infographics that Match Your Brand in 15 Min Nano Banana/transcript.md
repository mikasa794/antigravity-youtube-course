[00:00:00] Hey everyone. So today I want to show
[00:00:02] you how to prompt Gemini's new Nano
[00:00:05] Banana Pro model to create beautiful
[00:00:07] infographics that match your brand every
[00:00:10] time. Look, here's the problem. If you
[00:00:12] just ask Nano Banana Pro to create a
[00:00:14] infographic, it's going to create a
[00:00:17] cluttered mess full of generic clip art
[00:00:19] and text that looks like this. This just
[00:00:21] looks really bad in my opinion. Just to
[00:00:24] hammer the point home, I wrote a post
[00:00:27] about what's going to happen to product
[00:00:28] management anyway, right? It's a pretty
[00:00:30] long post and I wanted to create an
[00:00:33] infographic for it. So, here's a
[00:00:36] comparison of two infographics for the
[00:00:38] post. On the left side, I just wrote
[00:00:41] create a infographic for this and pasted
[00:00:43] the full text of the post. And on the
[00:00:45] right side, I used my custom AI prompt
[00:00:48] by following the five steps that I'm
[00:00:50] going to cover next. And you can see the
[00:00:53] real difference between the AI slop on
[00:00:55] the left and the infographic that
[00:00:57] actually matches my brand guidelines on
[00:00:59] the right. All right, so let me show you
[00:01:01] exactly how to create infographic on the
[00:01:03] right. So step one is simple. There's
[00:01:06] actually three different ways to use
[00:01:08] Nano Banana Pro and I prefer to use
[00:01:10] regular Gemini because it's free to try
[00:01:13] and it also lets you iterate with your
[00:01:15] own prompt. However, the images that you
[00:01:17] generate have a Gemini watermark at the
[00:01:20] bottom right, but you can easily use AI
[00:01:22] to remove that afterwards.
[00:01:25] Now, you can also use Notebook LM. And
[00:01:27] notebook LM is also free to try and
[00:01:30] doesn't have the Gemini watermark and it
[00:01:32] creates pretty decent infographics.
[00:01:34] Let's take a look at this infographic
[00:01:35] right here for my AIPM post. You can see
[00:01:39] that this looks pretty good, but it
[00:01:41] doesn't quite match my brand guidelines.
[00:01:44] And crucially, you cannot iterate on the
[00:01:46] infographic afterwards using chat, which
[00:01:49] to me is a deal breakaker. And the third
[00:01:52] option is to use Google AI Studio. And
[00:01:56] Google AI Studio arguably gives you the
[00:01:58] most control over your prompt and
[00:02:01] infographic. And it doesn't have the
[00:02:02] Gemini watermark either. However, as you
[00:02:05] can see here, you have to pay to use
[00:02:07] Nano Banana Pro. It's around 10 cents or
[00:02:10] 20 cents per image. And you know,
[00:02:12] because we're cheap and I want all of
[00:02:14] you guys to try this, I think let's just
[00:02:16] stick with regular old Gemini. All
[00:02:18] right, so step two is to work with AI to
[00:02:23] create a style guide. And this is the
[00:02:26] key step to make the infographic match
[00:02:28] your brand. Your style guide should
[00:02:30] include aspect ratio. Uh you can choose
[00:02:33] either 9x6, which is a vertical ratio,
[00:02:36] 16x9, which is horizontal, or square.
[00:02:39] And for social media post and
[00:02:40] infographics, I prefer 9 by6.
[00:02:44] Number two, you should specify to have
[00:02:46] at least 1K resolution. Of course, you
[00:02:48] can also go up to 2K or 4K, but the
[00:02:51] point is not to have a low resolution
[00:02:53] infographic.
[00:02:54] Number three, you should choose your
[00:02:56] primary color and two or three secondary
[00:02:58] colors that match it and also a
[00:03:01] background color. I like to just go with
[00:03:02] white for the background color. Uh
[00:03:04] number four, you should choose your font
[00:03:06] and typography, your font size, your
[00:03:09] font style for both the title and body
[00:03:12] text of the infographic. And number
[00:03:14] five, you should choose your ideal
[00:03:16] layout. For example, a grid with
[00:03:18] generous white space. And number six is
[00:03:21] most importantly, you should choose your
[00:03:23] illustration style. You can also refer
[00:03:25] to a popular style. For example, you can
[00:03:27] include in your prompt that illustration
[00:03:29] should look like New Yorker or Harvard
[00:03:32] Business Review cartoons. Now it is
[00:03:34] really important describe all of this in
[00:03:37] detail to get the consistent
[00:03:39] infographics that match your brand. And
[00:03:42] if you have a reference image that helps
[00:03:44] too. So let me show you an example here.
[00:03:48] I created a prompt where you can see
[00:03:50] here that I included all these details
[00:03:52] and it's generated this infographic that
[00:03:55] basically matches my brand exactly. I
[00:03:58] have the red circle here. I have a
[00:04:00] pretty detailed illustrations and uh it
[00:04:03] hasn't added a bunch of extraneous text.
[00:04:06] So now let's take a look at my style
[00:04:08] guide for uh behind the craft my
[00:04:11] newsletter and podcast. Here are some
[00:04:13] examples of images and art that I got a
[00:04:16] professional designer to make for me.
[00:04:18] You can see here that we have a distinct
[00:04:21] red circle around the most important
[00:04:23] word in the title. We have detailed
[00:04:25] illustrations with red as the accent
[00:04:28] color and you know some other colors to
[00:04:30] complement it. And overall it's just
[00:04:32] this like pretty clean look, right? So
[00:04:36] what I did is I just uploaded some of
[00:04:38] these images to AI. You can use chat
[00:04:41] JBT, Gemini or Claude and just iterate
[00:04:44] with AI to create a style guide based on
[00:04:47] the six attributes that I described
[00:04:49] before. Okay. So here's my actual prompt
[00:04:53] that I use to create my infographics. So
[00:04:55] you can see here that I've included the
[00:04:57] aspect ratio and the resolution at the
[00:04:59] very top. And I've also included
[00:05:01] detailed instructions on the colors,
[00:05:03] text, layout, and illustrations. And
[00:05:06] here I've described the style of
[00:05:08] illustrations. You know, I want
[00:05:10] editorial ink and wash illustrations. I
[00:05:12] want line work that looks like sketchy
[00:05:14] visible brush strokes. I want watercolor
[00:05:17] wash shading. And you know, how did I
[00:05:20] come up with these descriptions? Well,
[00:05:22] the truth is I basically uploaded some
[00:05:24] of these images into AI and then
[00:05:27] iterated with AI to create the prompt
[00:05:30] for the illustration here. You don't
[00:05:32] have to do this by yourself from
[00:05:33] scratch. You should work with AI to get
[00:05:35] to a style that you like. Once you have
[00:05:38] a style guide, you can basically paste
[00:05:41] the prompt into Gemini. And you can see
[00:05:44] here it will generate an infographic
[00:05:45] that very closely matches your style.
[00:05:48] Okay, but we're not quite done with the
[00:05:51] prompt yet. The style guy is the key
[00:05:53] step, but there are more steps. And the
[00:05:55] next step is to ask Gemini to generate
[00:05:59] the prompt in two steps. So, when you're
[00:06:02] generating infographics, one thing I
[00:06:04] found that's really annoying is that
[00:06:05] Nano Banana Pro tends to add random text
[00:06:09] even if we tell it not to. So, to fix
[00:06:11] it, I found it best to prompt it to
[00:06:13] generate an infographic in two steps. So
[00:06:16] the first step going back to our prompt
[00:06:18] is actually just to parse the text that
[00:06:20] I paste to extract the title and the
[00:06:23] section headers of the text. So you can
[00:06:26] see here that this is a pretty long blog
[00:06:28] post, but there's a clear title here and
[00:06:30] there's also clear section headers,
[00:06:33] right? And my instructions is use the
[00:06:35] exact headlines. Don't try to make up
[00:06:37] text and do not include any other text
[00:06:40] because this is really annoying to have
[00:06:42] to prompt Gemini afterwards to remove
[00:06:44] the text. And once they extract text,
[00:06:47] then apply the style guide that we did
[00:06:49] talked about in the previous step. So
[00:06:52] that's exactly what we did in the prompt
[00:06:54] prompt here. If you look at it in
[00:06:55] detail, yes, create a infographic, but
[00:06:58] step one first parse the text and step
[00:07:01] two apply to style guide. And I've added
[00:07:05] here. Now I'm going to paste some text
[00:07:06] to you and I want you to follow
[00:07:08] directions above exactly and Gemini
[00:07:11] basically you know says it's ready and
[00:07:14] after that I paste it in my full blog
[00:07:16] post. Okay so again separating out into
[00:07:19] two steps to parse the text first I
[00:07:21] think is really important. All right
[00:07:23] let's keep going. The prompt I just
[00:07:25] shared generates infographics using my
[00:07:28] brand guidelines. But of course you
[00:07:31] shouldn't just use my brand guidelines.
[00:07:32] you should customize it for your own
[00:07:34] brand and an infographic style that you
[00:07:36] like. All right. And to do that, it's
[00:07:39] very simple. So, the first step here is
[00:07:42] just to paste a few images of
[00:07:44] infographic style that you like. For
[00:07:46] example, I really love Liz Foslin's uh
[00:07:50] handdrawn style here, cartoony style. I
[00:07:53] think it's really really great. So going
[00:07:56] back to Gemini, you can just copy a few
[00:07:58] images here from this style and prompt
[00:08:02] it to update this illustration part of
[00:08:04] the prompt to reflect the attach style
[00:08:06] and keep the rest the same. And I
[00:08:08] basically copy and paste it over the
[00:08:10] illustration part of my prompt. And
[00:08:13] Gemini will go ahead and review the
[00:08:15] images and update it based on desired
[00:08:17] style. So Liz's style is simple, clean
[00:08:20] lines, minimalist shading, cartoonish
[00:08:22] proportions, and so on and so forth.
[00:08:24] Right? Then all you have to do is just
[00:08:27] ask Gemini to generate the infographic
[00:08:29] based on this new style. It's as simple
[00:08:31] as that. And you can see here the
[00:08:33] results are quite good, right? Like it
[00:08:35] generated based on Liz's uh cartoony
[00:08:38] style. It still applied my brand colors.
[00:08:41] It's not perfect. It didn't just circle
[00:08:43] one word. It circled the entire header
[00:08:45] with a red circle. Basically, what I'm
[00:08:47] saying here is that uh you can remix the
[00:08:49] prompt that I just shared. And by the
[00:08:52] way, I will include a link to the prompt
[00:08:53] in description, but you can basically
[00:08:55] remix the prompt to generate
[00:08:58] infographics in different styles by
[00:09:00] providing reference images. Okay, it's
[00:09:04] as simple as that. Now, of course, um
[00:09:07] before you start generating infographics
[00:09:09] based on my style or this style, try to
[00:09:12] at least get permission or come up with
[00:09:13] your own distinct style. All right, so
[00:09:17] my final tip is to iterate with AI and
[00:09:20] then save your prompt. Unlike most AI
[00:09:24] image models, Nano Banana is great at
[00:09:27] conversational edits. That means you
[00:09:29] should always iterate first instead of
[00:09:32] starting over from scratch. So for
[00:09:33] example, let's say I want to make tweaks
[00:09:35] to this infographic, right? I can
[00:09:37] basically say things like make sure the
[00:09:40] red circle is only on the most important
[00:09:45] title word and let's say uh update the
[00:09:50] layout to be a two across
[00:09:54] layout.
[00:09:55] And for fun, why don't we also get it to
[00:09:58] update one of these illustrations. So uh
[00:10:00] let's say update the illustration for
[00:10:05] taking AI courses and certificates is
[00:10:08] not building. All right. So now it's
[00:10:12] going to hopefully uh generate a new
[00:10:13] image uh with these changes and let's
[00:10:16] skip ahead to see what it comes up with.
[00:10:19] Okay. This is what it came up with. And
[00:10:22] unfortunately it reverted back to my
[00:10:24] original style instead of Liz's but it
[00:10:26] didn't make the changes that we want. We
[00:10:27] make the red circle the most important
[00:10:29] title word. We updated the layout to be
[00:10:31] two across and it looks like it did
[00:10:34] replace the taking AI courses image
[00:10:37] right here. After you've iterated on the
[00:10:40] infographic here's like a pro tip,
[00:10:42] right? So, what you want to do is you
[00:10:44] want to say now update my infographic
[00:10:48] prompt to include all of these edits
[00:10:49] that we just made so that we can get to
[00:10:51] this output in one shot and keep the
[00:10:55] character count of the prompt around the
[00:10:56] same and Gemini will uh take account of
[00:11:00] all this conversation history that we
[00:11:02] have and hopefully it will go ahead and
[00:11:05] update our prompt. All right, so here we
[00:11:07] are. So, look looks like Gemini has
[00:11:09] updated the prompt. One thing I forgot
[00:11:11] to do is just to say bold any edits that
[00:11:13] you make so we can actually review
[00:11:14] Gemini's updates and make sure that it
[00:11:16] makes sense. But now that we have this
[00:11:18] new prompt, hopefully it will help us
[00:11:20] generate the infographic that we want
[00:11:22] much faster. So the point is you're
[00:11:25] always improving your infographic prompt
[00:11:26] over time by asking Gemini to update it
[00:11:29] after you make a few adjustments.
[00:11:32] All right, I got one final tip for you
[00:11:34] guys. Now, when you go to Gemini, you
[00:11:37] can click on this gems thing. And gems
[00:11:39] is basically Gemini's version of an AI
[00:11:42] project. So now we can go ahead and
[00:11:45] actually hit new gem and let's just call
[00:11:47] it infographic.
[00:11:49] And let's just copy and paste this whole
[00:11:51] infographic prompt in here. Right. And
[00:11:55] uh let's put it into the instructions
[00:11:58] right here. And let's hit save. And now
[00:12:02] we don't have to copy and paste that
[00:12:03] long prompt every single time. All we
[00:12:06] have to do is copy and paste whatever
[00:12:08] text we want to make an infographic and
[00:12:11] Gemini will hopefully make an
[00:12:12] infographic for us that matches our
[00:12:14] brand style. So just to be uh you know
[00:12:17] extremely meta, I have a post here on
[00:12:21] creating infographics with the tips that
[00:12:22] we just covered. And let's actually ask
[00:12:24] Gemini to make an infographic for this
[00:12:26] post. All right. So paste the title in
[00:12:30] and paste this whole post. It's uh
[00:12:33] basically what we just covered and let's
[00:12:36] see if Gemini actually makes a great
[00:12:38] infographic for this. Okay, so here we
[00:12:41] are. Let's take a look at this
[00:12:42] infographic.
[00:12:43] All right, so you can see here is
[00:12:45] largely match my brand with my red
[00:12:47] circles. It's created detailed
[00:12:49] illustrations for this stuff and yeah,
[00:12:52] it looks great. I don't really like the
[00:12:54] robots. So let's say no more robots. And
[00:12:58] let's let's also say maybe add a text
[00:13:01] description below each section. And
[00:13:05] let's see what it comes up with. Okay,
[00:13:07] that took like a few seconds to
[00:13:09] generate. And now we have our
[00:13:11] infographic. We've added a test
[00:13:14] description below each section to kind
[00:13:17] of make it more obvious. We got rid of
[00:13:19] the robot. Some of the graphics I think
[00:13:21] can be improved, but the point is again
[00:13:23] you can iterate with Gemini to make your
[00:13:25] infographic better. And then you can
[00:13:27] just basically say now update the
[00:13:29] original prompt so that we can get this
[00:13:32] output in one shot, right? And then
[00:13:34] you're going to have just a really
[00:13:35] amazing gem project to help you create
[00:13:38] really great brand assets and
[00:13:39] infographics for all the content that
[00:13:42] you make over time. So here's a quick
[00:13:45] recap of all five steps. Number one, use
[00:13:48] regular Gemini. It's free and lets you
[00:13:51] iterate through chat. Number two, create
[00:13:54] a detailed style guide. Uh, it should
[00:13:56] include the aspect ratio, colors,
[00:13:59] typography, layout, and most
[00:14:01] importantly, the illustrations. If you
[00:14:03] need help creating a prompt for the
[00:14:04] illustrations, just upload a few
[00:14:06] reference images and ask Gemini to
[00:14:09] create it for you. Or again, you can
[00:14:11] check out the link in my description to
[00:14:12] get my prompt and just modify that. All
[00:14:15] right, number three is structure your
[00:14:17] prompt in two steps. The first step is
[00:14:19] you want to extract the relevant text,
[00:14:21] right? For example, my prompt is to
[00:14:23] extract just the title and the section
[00:14:25] headers. And then you want to ask Gemini
[00:14:28] to just use that test for infographic
[00:14:30] and apply your style guide. And number
[00:14:33] four, customize the whole prompt for
[00:14:36] your brand. And again, all you have to
[00:14:38] do is just show AI some styles that you
[00:14:40] like and then ask it to edit the prompt
[00:14:43] and maybe do a manual pass afterwards.
[00:14:45] And number five is to iterate and save
[00:14:48] the prompt. So give Gemini additional
[00:14:50] instructions to improve our infographic.
[00:14:52] You can ask it to add more text, add
[00:14:54] more white space, change some colors, so
[00:14:56] on so forth. And then after you're done
[00:14:58] all your edits and you have infographic
[00:14:59] that you're happy with, ask it to update
[00:15:02] the original prompt and then save that
[00:15:04] prompt in a Gemini gem or project so
[00:15:07] that in the future all you have to do is
[00:15:09] just to paste in some text that you
[00:15:11] wrote and then it will generate onbrand
[00:15:13] infographics each time without you
[00:15:15] having to paste prompt over and over
[00:15:17] again. So that's it and this is a pretty
[00:15:20] simple tutorial but I think this is a
[00:15:21] game changanger personally for my own
[00:15:23] workflows and I hope this tutorial helps
[00:15:26] you generate professional infographics
[00:15:28] or even other marketing assets. You can
[00:15:30] follow the exact same steps in just a
[00:15:32] few minutes. So tag me on social if you
[00:15:34] make something great and be sure to like
[00:15:37] and subscribe so that I can make more
[00:15:39] practical AI tutorials like this. Thanks
[00:15:41] again for watching.
