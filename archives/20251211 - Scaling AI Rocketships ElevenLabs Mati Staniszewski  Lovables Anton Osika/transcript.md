[00:00:00] 5% of the world can even code and much
[00:00:03] fewer can build a great product like
[00:00:05] Mati and his co-founder right so I
[00:00:08] decided let's build something for the
[00:00:10] 99% and not this productivity boost for
[00:00:13] developers and that's going to be a
[00:00:14] completely new type of interface so here
[00:00:17] we don't give any timelines we do
[00:00:19] research initiatives we want to plan you
[00:00:21] need to stay nimble that like the moment
[00:00:23] it comes out you have 24 hours to start
[00:00:25] integrating that into your product
[00:00:26] that's like the most important time to
[00:00:28] really to really be ahead
[00:00:36] >> [music]
[00:00:47] >> Okay, this is a real treat. Um, I
[00:00:49] interviewed two friends of mine, Matty
[00:00:52] from 11 Labs and Anton from Lovable. two
[00:00:55] terrific CEOs and companies that are
[00:00:58] absolutely ripping and they're both
[00:01:00] doing it from ye old Europe. So, we're
[00:01:03] going to get into it on the Europe
[00:01:04] thing, but there's some topics that are
[00:01:06] just terrific. These two are kind of
[00:01:08] blossoming before our eyes. They're
[00:01:10] right in the the heart of hyperrowth.
[00:01:13] And we get to see like how they think
[00:01:14] about co-founders, how they're thinking
[00:01:16] about delegation and letting go, how
[00:01:19] they're thinking about building their
[00:01:20] exec teams, managing all the chaos
[00:01:23] coming in at them. When you're in
[00:01:24] hyperrowth, there's just a lot of chaos
[00:01:26] and really just pushing to keep the
[00:01:28] speed up. It's a really good episode. I
[00:01:30] hope you enjoy it and I'll be back at
[00:01:32] the end with my takes. Okay, you two are
[00:01:36] in your early 30s, similar ages. Uh
[00:01:40] you've got some very good experience
[00:01:42] under your belt. Um a lot of founders
[00:01:45] I'm meeting and a lot of founders
[00:01:47] getting funded are right in school,
[00:01:48] right out of school, 21, 22. What would
[00:01:51] your companies be like if you had
[00:01:53] started them when you were 21 or 22?
[00:01:55] I'll let you go.
[00:01:56] >> Well, I think I think it would be have
[00:01:58] have been hard. Uh I think it still
[00:02:01] would have the pleasure of working with
[00:02:02] my co-founder. I know him since high
[00:02:04] school. Okay.
[00:02:05] >> Uh so we always were best friends. We
[00:02:06] did everything together.
[00:02:08] >> This is Mati from 11 Labs.
[00:02:10] >> Exactly. So uh so uh I'm working across
[00:02:13] voice AI research and product
[00:02:14] deployment. We are on a mission to
[00:02:15] create the voice of technology. Um so I
[00:02:18] think I still would have started without
[00:02:19] that with my co-founder which would have
[00:02:21] been the advantage. The disadvantage is
[00:02:23] I don't know how I would approach the
[00:02:25] first customers. How the world like at
[00:02:28] the time I didn't even know the world of
[00:02:29] entrepreneurship existed. So I studied
[00:02:31] mathematics. uh when you study
[00:02:33] mathematics the clear career paths you
[00:02:35] take is either finance or consulting. I
[00:02:38] chose finance. I joined Black Rockck. Um
[00:02:40] and then of only after Black Rockck I
[00:02:42] learned about Palunteer uh and decided
[00:02:44] to join them where it turned out you can
[00:02:46] actually be deployed with the customer,
[00:02:48] learn about the problems, try to
[00:02:49] understand those problems and bring them
[00:02:50] back and build a product which was like
[00:02:52] the first glimpse into how to build
[00:02:54] something from scratch. Uh but before
[00:02:56] that was still some further out of I
[00:02:59] didn't know how to approach. Um so I
[00:03:00] don't think I would be able to
[00:03:02] understand the first early dynamics of
[00:03:04] starting something in the same way.
[00:03:06] >> Okay. you're several hundred million in
[00:03:08] revenue. If you would started right out
[00:03:09] of school with your buddy,
[00:03:12] where would you be?
[00:03:14] >> Nowhere.
[00:03:15] >> You know, the other thing I I think we
[00:03:17] would have probably worked on a very
[00:03:19] different idea. I think it took
[00:03:20] >> the of course the pleasure of having the
[00:03:23] the co-ounder I know inside out. Um then
[00:03:26] over the years got experience of working
[00:03:27] at other companies which helped us
[00:03:29] understand some of the dynamics. He also
[00:03:31] at Google at Palanteer. So we understand
[00:03:32] how to build things at scale. But then
[00:03:35] the third thing which I think was the
[00:03:36] most important was was the idea. And of
[00:03:37] course through the years we looked into
[00:03:39] different projects from trying to build
[00:03:42] a crypto risk analyzer during the crypto
[00:03:44] days which was really hard uh to
[00:03:46] recommendation system. But then when we
[00:03:48] stumbled on on voice we knew that a this
[00:03:51] is a good timing where the technology is
[00:03:53] going for the shift. We can be part of
[00:03:54] that shift of that technology and then
[00:03:56] two this is a huge problem that uh that
[00:03:58] the problem that the users the world
[00:04:00] have and we can solve it. If I started
[00:04:03] something on 21 22, I just don't think
[00:04:05] we would work on the same idea and
[00:04:07] probably uh wouldn't understand the pain
[00:04:09] the same way we do now that that we
[00:04:11] approached voice.
[00:04:12] >> Got it. Anton lovable also on fire. If
[00:04:15] you were started this company right out
[00:04:17] of school, what would it be like?
[00:04:18] [snorts]
[00:04:19] >> Um I I also think it might have not been
[00:04:22] as ambitious because I mean I had never
[00:04:24] done something entrepreneurial. Um, and
[00:04:27] the biggest disadvantage being that
[00:04:30] young would have been that I wouldn't
[00:04:32] know like why to hire very senior
[00:04:34] engineers and what may like what type of
[00:04:36] great senior engineers are out there.
[00:04:38] >> Um, because like they don't want they
[00:04:40] will be very scared of working for me.
[00:04:42] Um, but I think I would have a lot of
[00:04:44] other advantages maybe even being more
[00:04:46] naive. Um, and
[00:04:49] already then I think I surrounded myself
[00:04:51] by super super smart people. So I I
[00:04:53] could have I think I could have built
[00:04:54] something uh very different with fast
[00:04:57] iteration place could have been
[00:04:58] successful.
[00:04:59] >> And I got a little bit of what you took
[00:05:01] from Palunteer. Um you had some very
[00:05:03] interesting experiences before lovable.
[00:05:06] Can you talk a little bit about them and
[00:05:07] what kind of you took from those that
[00:05:09] you're le leveraging at lovable?
[00:05:11] >> Yeah sure. So if you go way way back, we
[00:05:13] I also studied like sciences and physics
[00:05:16] specifically and when I was uh I did
[00:05:18] this long internship at CERN where uh I
[00:05:22] understood a certain particle physics
[00:05:24] and where they discovered a lot of the
[00:05:27] recent physics but but there's a lot of
[00:05:29] smart people there and I was like wait
[00:05:31] they're all working on these impossible
[00:05:33] problems without any elasticity. So, uh
[00:05:35] I'm not going to be here. I'm going to
[00:05:37] go u applying great innovation to the
[00:05:41] real world. Um and then um I was kind of
[00:05:45] inspired to start a company when I was
[00:05:47] um in university which I'm very happy
[00:05:49] about but I uh ended up um doing doing
[00:05:53] some finance actually unfortunately
[00:05:55] unfortunately [laughter]
[00:05:57] >> which was a bit too boring for me. Okay.
[00:05:59] Um but fortunately I started this um
[00:06:02] community Stockholm AI and this was
[00:06:04] around when deep learning was like
[00:06:05] taking off in 2015 16 and I I I did the
[00:06:10] foundation models of training current
[00:06:13] new like large small language models
[00:06:15] before it was cool and met great people
[00:06:17] there and one was the founder at SA to
[00:06:20] Joel who recently sold Sonnet for to
[00:06:23] workday for a billion dollars.
[00:06:24] >> Yes, congratulations.
[00:06:25] >> Yes, great job by the team there. I mean
[00:06:27] my contribution was bring in some of
[00:06:29] those smart people that went on to to
[00:06:31] grow it to what what it became. Um and I
[00:06:33] was there for three years and it was
[00:06:35] like oh AI like let's build we were you
[00:06:38] all was super young uh but uh we we
[00:06:41] learned super fast and it it became
[00:06:43] successful. Then I joined uh as a
[00:06:45] co-founder at a company that just got
[00:06:48] into YC um and that was in
[00:06:50] recommendation systems specifically for
[00:06:52] e-commerce. uh that could have been
[00:06:54] absolutely wildly successful the company
[00:06:56] it had a lot of things going for it but
[00:06:59] um after a bit of momentum loss and my
[00:07:03] co-f founder and I like uh and me being
[00:07:07] I I wanted to pivot to something more
[00:07:09] successful that that I can say than
[00:07:10] e-commerce um but I decided to do some
[00:07:13] do do the most possible ambitious thing
[00:07:16] and all my life I've been uh
[00:07:20] like approached by people who wanted to
[00:07:23] find a great engineer to help them
[00:07:25] realize their dreams or the ideas. uh
[00:07:27] the world is full of them like 0.5% of
[00:07:30] the world can even code and much fewer
[00:07:32] can build a great product like Mati and
[00:07:35] his co-founder right so um I decided
[00:07:39] let's build something for the 99% and
[00:07:41] not this productivity boost for
[00:07:43] developers and that's going to be a
[00:07:44] completely new type of interface
[00:07:47] >> where you um rim your idea of some
[00:07:51] technical AI product into existence and
[00:07:54] that's what we set out to build
[00:07:56] >> okay So um your first company you were
[00:07:59] the founding engineer.
[00:08:00] >> Yeah.
[00:08:01] >> Your next company depict you were
[00:08:03] co-founder CTO. Now you're CEO. Is it
[00:08:06] everything you ever hoped?
[00:08:08] >> Uh it's a good question. I I think it's
[00:08:11] quite uh different. And what I love
[00:08:13] about it is that I get to know myself um
[00:08:17] and like how to surround myself with the
[00:08:20] right like complimentary skill sets um
[00:08:23] and challen be challenged in all the
[00:08:25] possible ways much more than being a
[00:08:26] co-founder and CTO
[00:08:28] >> and um like I run the company on founder
[00:08:33] mode I would mostly empathize with uh
[00:08:36] but at this stage um I mean there's a a
[00:08:39] big shift in be in focusing on
[00:08:41] empowering unblocking the leaders in the
[00:08:44] company.
[00:08:44] >> Um, and I mean I I like that and it's
[00:08:48] more analytical
[00:08:50] >> is being a CEO what you thought like
[00:08:52] what surprised you about it?
[00:08:54] >> Um, you have to do so many things or I
[00:08:57] mean unless you're very uh disciplined
[00:09:00] about what what you delegate and how you
[00:09:01] delegate it. It's like there's all so
[00:09:04] many many different things thrown at you
[00:09:06] especially as you start hyperscaling.
[00:09:09] >> Yes. Um, how about for you? You're CEO,
[00:09:12] your first time CEO. What's harder than
[00:09:15] you thought? What's easier than the
[00:09:16] thought? What's different than you
[00:09:18] thought?
[00:09:20] >> Yeah, I think the the first one is
[00:09:22] definitely you want to hire people
[00:09:23] better than yourself in all those areas
[00:09:25] that that you know for the first time.
[00:09:26] In our case, things like legal or
[00:09:28] finance or um building the gotom market
[00:09:31] motion in sales, like all of these
[00:09:33] things which I've seen kind of results
[00:09:36] of that work but never have actually
[00:09:38] done the work. Yeah.
[00:09:39] >> So it was a very quick learning of like
[00:09:41] how do you do that so you actually
[00:09:42] understand it and you need to understand
[00:09:43] at least a little bit to then be able
[00:09:45] and assess the person that you want to
[00:09:47] bring in. So that was kind of the the
[00:09:49] two things that that uh they now
[00:09:50] repetitively try to do when we have a
[00:09:52] new area. I'm trying to first put myself
[00:09:54] in those shoes, understand the basics
[00:09:56] and then hire persons I know that they
[00:09:57] are doing that work. And the delegation
[00:10:00] too was uh was something that I I think
[00:10:02] I hold on for for too long like like to
[00:10:05] to do myself rather than than delegate.
[00:10:07] And then actually how to delegate was an
[00:10:09] interesting piece in itself where um I
[00:10:13] think you you do want to give a lot of a
[00:10:15] lot of the the the work to other leaders
[00:10:17] that you hire the other people that you
[00:10:18] grow um but you still want to understand
[00:10:21] the detail that's happening and then
[00:10:22] like how do you let them own it be the
[00:10:25] leaders they want to be but still remain
[00:10:27] in the details in the funer mode to to
[00:10:29] be able to jump in when needed. uh that
[00:10:31] balance of like how do you interact
[00:10:32] through that is is is is a tricky thing
[00:10:35] that uh that is still I think a
[00:10:37] continuous learning for me
[00:10:39] >> and like I found that there's kind of
[00:10:40] three types of CEOs is people who are
[00:10:43] really in all the details in in
[00:10:45] everyone's shorts all the time there are
[00:10:48] CEOs that are pretty high level and like
[00:10:51] I have an expression keep your feet in
[00:10:52] the ground your head in the head in the
[00:10:54] clouds or you're in the details and
[00:10:56] you're up high some people who stay very
[00:10:57] high and then there's what I call
[00:10:59] spelunkers people kind of go down deep
[00:11:01] in one thing for a while, then come back
[00:11:03] out and go down into another thing. Have
[00:11:06] you got one of those models? Is that is
[00:11:09] that like what are you? It sounds like
[00:11:10] you're the first.
[00:11:12] >> I do like the details. I think similar
[00:11:14] like the the uh I think to to to how
[00:11:17] Anon um mentioned that that you operate
[00:11:20] is like you do want the the fun. You
[00:11:22] want to understand the product. You want
[00:11:23] to actually work with the product all
[00:11:24] the time. So you know how to actually um
[00:11:28] uh use the product better than than than
[00:11:30] most. So I'm trying to trying to stay
[00:11:32] extremely detailed and like what it is
[00:11:34] that we are shipping, how we're shipping
[00:11:35] it, how it works behind the scenes. So
[00:11:37] that's probably the the key thing. Um I
[00:11:40] like your analogy of of uh um head in
[00:11:43] the clouds, the
[00:11:46] the feet on the ground. I think the the
[00:11:48] the thing that I'm trying and I and I
[00:11:50] think uh where where the the magic
[00:11:52] happens if you do it well is being able
[00:11:54] to zoom out and zoom zoom in extremely
[00:11:56] quickly before those context. So you're
[00:11:58] able to understand the problem, zoom
[00:12:00] into the detail, you understand the
[00:12:01] detail and then the next second you need
[00:12:03] to go to another problem which requires
[00:12:05] the same activity.
[00:12:05] >> There's a lot of context switching being
[00:12:07] a CEO.
[00:12:07] >> Exactly. And that's uh and you kind of
[00:12:10] need to be immediate in that. um um my
[00:12:13] co-founder who who is the smartest
[00:12:14] person I know and is kind of leading the
[00:12:16] research uh work in his case he needs to
[00:12:20] go extremely deep for very long time so
[00:12:22] we like have very we frequently speak
[00:12:24] about this very different way of
[00:12:26] approaching the the work where one is
[00:12:28] like all about context switching the
[00:12:29] other one is all about going as deep as
[00:12:30] possible
[00:12:31] >> and how about what are you thinking on
[00:12:33] how are you feeling about delegation is
[00:12:35] it natural just delegate all this stuff
[00:12:36] or is it like ah I want to be in the
[00:12:38] details I had a hard I had a very hard
[00:12:40] time delegating
[00:12:42] Um I think it's often the ah when I'm
[00:12:45] I'm very impatient generally and
[00:12:49] >> um like [laughter] there is some
[00:12:51] friction when I when there's many things
[00:12:54] that are feel very urgent and I know
[00:12:56] know one thing but maybe not all the
[00:12:58] other ones.
[00:12:59] >> Are you driving people crazy?
[00:13:01] >> Um no mostly no. Mostly they like me.
[00:13:03] They they feel where I'm coming from and
[00:13:05] I usually this this is coming from a
[00:13:07] good place. Um
[00:13:08] >> okay let's talk about team. You just
[00:13:09] hired a friend of mine to run sales.
[00:13:12] >> Yeah.
[00:13:12] >> Um you're building out your team. How
[00:13:14] are you thinking about building out your
[00:13:16] team, your senior team in particular?
[00:13:18] And then are you looking
[00:13:20] >> are you looking for people with high
[00:13:21] slope or high experience?
[00:13:23] >> Oh, that's a good question. I I think
[00:13:25] like at this stage um there's some
[00:13:28] there's many things we just like need to
[00:13:31] be done uh very predictably and um like
[00:13:37] because of like all the opportunities
[00:13:38] that are out there and hiring people who
[00:13:40] have done it before and are maybe
[00:13:44] wouldn't be as effective early stage
[00:13:46] because they're like set in their ways
[00:13:48] that that is very effective. It's very
[00:13:50] effective.
[00:13:51] >> Oh, wait. So you you lean towards
[00:13:52] experience not necessarily
[00:13:54] >> for the things that have to get done we
[00:13:55] know like what those things are it is
[00:13:58] effective to like what
[00:13:59] >> uh so for sales um everything that come
[00:14:02] goes under sales a lot of fun sub
[00:14:03] functions of marketing that has like all
[00:14:05] of this you're
[00:14:06] >> looking for experience there
[00:14:07] >> I'm looking for experience and then so
[00:14:10] uh at least to run them and then um one
[00:14:13] if you have capacity to also hire people
[00:14:15] people with high slopes and who are like
[00:14:18] generalists and you also find a good way
[00:14:20] to be able to move them around in the
[00:14:21] company. Um, that's something that has
[00:14:24] worked really well for us.
[00:14:26] >> Um, I I can cannot predict how it's
[00:14:28] going to work when there's more
[00:14:30] structure in the company, but I'm
[00:14:32] committed to finding a good experiment.
[00:14:34] >> Any of these highs slope generalists who
[00:14:36] you're moving around on your senior
[00:14:38] team, direct reports, senior team
[00:14:39] >> senior team or
[00:14:41] >> any of are any of your direct reports
[00:14:43] any of these
[00:14:44] >> you know high slope people moving
[00:14:46] around? um not on my like actual
[00:14:49] leadership team, but many of the ones I
[00:14:51] work with dayto-day who like feel like
[00:14:53] they're reporting directly to me on many
[00:14:55] things are more of the highest.
[00:14:56] >> Yeah.
[00:14:57] >> How about you on the team? You're
[00:14:58] building you're got a little you've got
[00:14:59] a few hundred employees. You're less
[00:15:01] than 100.
[00:15:02] >> Um
[00:15:03] >> what are you thinking about the senior
[00:15:04] team? What are you looking for? Have you
[00:15:06] had any misfires?
[00:15:08] >> In our case, so we have we have we have
[00:15:10] over 300 people, but uh inside of the
[00:15:12] company, it's effectively a lot of small
[00:15:14] teams has 30 teams of five to 10 people.
[00:15:16] And it usually is a combination of um
[00:15:19] depending on the space either few with
[00:15:22] with with with the experience with the
[00:15:24] past um work in that space and then
[00:15:26] usually infused with some of the high
[00:15:28] slope and we we like that because a you
[00:15:31] get the generalists that can adopt a lot
[00:15:33] of the new tooling and kind of do new
[00:15:35] work. Um and second we try to bring a
[00:15:37] lot the engineers across in some of
[00:15:38] those teams. So even in a traditional
[00:15:40] growth team, we have growth engineers
[00:15:42] and the ops team will have operations
[00:15:44] engineering to help automate a lot of
[00:15:46] the process. Um sometimes use lovable in
[00:15:49] the in the process to to help to help
[00:15:51] with that work and um and and that has
[00:15:54] that has helped tremendously to kind of
[00:15:56] get the experience the domain expertise
[00:15:58] while while creating the new the new
[00:16:01] process across the leadership. So then
[00:16:03] all those team roll up to each effective
[00:16:05] lead. So we have a go to market leads.
[00:16:07] Um then the engineering leads.
[00:16:09] >> How many direct reports do you have?
[00:16:10] >> I have 15 direct reports.
[00:16:12] >> That's a lot. Okay. And that crew of 15
[00:16:16] are they kind of young hungry grow up at
[00:16:19] the company high slope or are they kind
[00:16:21] of been there done that?
[00:16:23] >> Almost exactly half half. So half half
[00:16:26] have done that before. Usually are
[00:16:27] growing with the role. Of course we are
[00:16:29] growing extremely quickly. So we grew
[00:16:30] from from we started 2022 from zero to
[00:16:33] now over 200 million in revenue. So that
[00:16:36] growth has been quick for for everybody.
[00:16:38] So everybody's learning at at the same
[00:16:40] time. But half of them have seen that
[00:16:42] before and the other half are
[00:16:45] >> the uh 50/50. Like at HubSpot we were
[00:16:48] kind of the same. I was I'd look around
[00:16:50] the table about half grew up with the
[00:16:52] company very high slope and half had a
[00:16:55] lot of experience. That felt right to
[00:16:57] me. Does that feel right to you? It
[00:16:59] does. It's so it's it's in in a many
[00:17:01] ways the people that are there have
[00:17:03] grown with the company incredibly. Uh
[00:17:06] Victoria who leads our ops team has
[00:17:08] never done anything like this before,
[00:17:10] right?
[00:17:10] >> And uh also from palunteer background so
[00:17:13] also physics background so trying to
[00:17:15] like create the process as as we go
[00:17:17] across and has grown incredibly with the
[00:17:19] company and then others um kind of are
[00:17:22] still super important for the company
[00:17:23] but will stay in more of the product
[00:17:25] teams or on the IC roles in other parts.
[00:17:28] How about you on the on the you know
[00:17:30] what's your mix of kind of homegrown and
[00:17:32] been there done that you're probably
[00:17:34] just starting to hire execs I guess from
[00:17:36] the outside.
[00:17:36] >> Yeah. So I built out this this
[00:17:39] leadership team which is like seven
[00:17:40] people with my co.
[00:17:41] >> So you have seven direct reports.
[00:17:43] >> Yeah. So with without me and my coffer
[00:17:46] it's five direct reports. Yeah.
[00:17:48] >> And officially everyone else like
[00:17:50] reports into them.
[00:17:51] >> Yeah. And
[00:17:52] >> do you feel like you got that right or
[00:17:53] over time it's going to get much bigger
[00:17:55] or where you at? Like I think of Jensen
[00:17:58] Huang has 45 direct reports and
[00:18:00] >> you have a lot too now.
[00:18:02] >> No, I didn't. I had like 10. No. Uh
[00:18:05] yeah. And it's amazing to me that they
[00:18:06] got people with 45 or 50 and people with
[00:18:09] three. Um there's such a range. Anyway,
[00:18:12] it it was the five intentional or it
[00:18:13] just kind of happened.
[00:18:14] >> Uh it was intentional. Very intentional.
[00:18:16] Yeah. Uh to like add a lot more add a
[00:18:19] lot more structure. And then if you I
[00:18:21] think generally like if you say okay
[00:18:23] let's try to have a lot of structure and
[00:18:24] then it's easier to add more like
[00:18:27] chaotic things on top of that.
[00:18:28] >> Yeah.
[00:18:29] >> And see how that works.
[00:18:30] >> Okay.
[00:18:30] >> So you're hiring we we kind of work
[00:18:32] together on that head of sales search.
[00:18:34] >> How are you thinking about these senior
[00:18:37] searches? How are you deciding? You know
[00:18:39] you never run a sales or it's a it's a
[00:18:42] hard thing like
[00:18:44] >> lots of people are in your shoes like
[00:18:45] how are you making those calls?
[00:18:48] >> Yes. O with the head of sales I worked I
[00:18:51] worked closely with Jany at Excel who
[00:18:53] had done this before many times.
[00:18:54] >> Okay. Danny Hersburg from
[00:18:57] Andy. Exactly. So and um
[00:19:00] >> they coached you. they got they got gave
[00:19:01] me a lot of impact input on it and um I
[00:19:04] mean in the end it was me spending a lot
[00:19:07] of time with this candidates and them
[00:19:08] spending time with the team um and
[00:19:11] presenting how they would do things and
[00:19:14] that that felt like that gave a lot of
[00:19:16] instilled a lot of confidence
[00:19:18] >> okay for me
[00:19:19] >> so you had a bunch of help
[00:19:21] >> yeah spoke to many people
[00:19:23] >> and how on your side same thing you
[00:19:25] hadn't run a sale you haven't none of us
[00:19:27] have done what we did but you hadn't run
[00:19:29] a sales or you had to make a decision on
[00:19:31] a sales leader. You had a lot of
[00:19:32] qualified candidates. How did you go
[00:19:34] about it?
[00:19:35] >> Yeah, you it's a tricky one and
[00:19:37] especially I think for sales the sales
[00:19:39] people know how to sell themselves. They
[00:19:40] need to be able so they are so you kind
[00:19:42] of need to filter through like do they
[00:19:44] actually uh know how to sell but they
[00:19:46] are all like good at it. So uh we we are
[00:19:49] in a good setup where one of the sales
[00:19:51] people was our investor. So we've seen
[00:19:53] him actually help um us advise before he
[00:19:57] became a salesperson. So when when we
[00:19:59] started the company we started getting
[00:20:00] enterprise inbound um we realized okay
[00:20:03] we can start something very quickly and
[00:20:05] he already has spent so much time with
[00:20:06] us then it became natural okay we want
[00:20:08] to bring that person in um and then as
[00:20:11] we've hired other roles we have of
[00:20:13] course amazing investors uh across like
[00:20:15] SEOA who are on recent team who are
[00:20:18] helping us uh on that hunt so we would
[00:20:21] partner very closely with the domain
[00:20:22] experts to to to to help us through the
[00:20:25] network through the back references to
[00:20:27] make sure that they are right ones. I
[00:20:28] think the back references really helps
[00:20:30] across that beyond the spending time
[00:20:31] with the with the team which which I
[00:20:33] think is crucial. Um and then the other
[00:20:36] part which which I haven't realized
[00:20:37] until later is the for sales
[00:20:39] specifically is that you are hiring of
[00:20:41] course a great individual for creating
[00:20:43] the sales uh playbook helping you sell
[00:20:45] into the enterprises but then ultimately
[00:20:48] the person you hire they will set the
[00:20:49] culture for the sales team too like a
[00:20:51] lot of the people they will hire will be
[00:20:53] so similar in the approach to that work
[00:20:56] um which uh which I didn't appreciate
[00:20:58] until the after the fact I was happy
[00:21:00] that the culture was very aligned but uh
[00:21:02] but then you can See they are very much
[00:21:04] similar and we have Europe and US sales
[00:21:07] team they're slightly different okay the
[00:21:09] Europe is a lot more confident like the
[00:21:12] a little bit like a lot the the European
[00:21:14] uh versus US upbringing so a lot more
[00:21:16] confident than our Europe European
[00:21:18] counterparts that take more of like
[00:21:19] partner sales approach
[00:21:21] >> u but they have core similar values
[00:21:23] which which helps
[00:21:24] >> okay one of the things that confuses me
[00:21:26] about life today as a CEO is like from
[00:21:30] HubSpot from let's call it we went
[00:21:33] public in 2012 until I sat down 2000
[00:21:35] 2020. We had an annual planning cycle
[00:21:38] and the world just didn't change a whole
[00:21:39] lot every year. How the hell do you guys
[00:21:42] plan with the changes going on
[00:21:44] underneath? Like what's your cycle? How
[00:21:46] do you do it?
[00:21:48] >> So, we've done very little planning.
[00:21:50] >> Okay. Um and I think that's pretty smart
[00:21:54] because uh you can like everything is
[00:21:56] changing very rapidly on as at least for
[00:22:00] our I mean our B2B offering is like
[00:22:03] enterprises are uh huge ones are using
[00:22:06] our product to a huge extent. Um we are
[00:22:10] just like giving trying to give them uh
[00:22:13] the time they can get like as as much
[00:22:15] time as you can get um and not being
[00:22:17] like okay this is our ICP this is
[00:22:19] exactly the sales process at least. so
[00:22:20] far. Um, but there there's like tens of
[00:22:23] thousand people in a hackathon. Some
[00:22:25] many of the world's like largest
[00:22:28] healthcare companies using us and we um
[00:22:33] we will I think start taking a step back
[00:22:35] uh and being okay where are we seeing u
[00:22:39] like from much better data and analytics
[00:22:41] as well. How where are we going to
[00:22:43] focus?
[00:22:43] >> Okay, let me push back a little bit. You
[00:22:45] just had a big release that looks
[00:22:47] amazing.
[00:22:48] >> You must have planned for that. You just
[00:22:49] didn't pull that out of a hackathon last
[00:22:51] week.
[00:22:51] >> Yeah. So, on [laughter] the first side,
[00:22:53] I mean, we we we do have a launch road
[00:22:55] map and like it goes out six No, it goes
[00:22:58] out like six months and it's just that I
[00:23:00] I'm sure it's
[00:23:02] >> uh going to change.
[00:23:03] >> Okay. So, there's a there's a
[00:23:05] lightweight six-month product roadmap.
[00:23:07] Yeah.
[00:23:07] >> Okay. Got it. And it's pretty flexible
[00:23:09] like within that six months deep pivot.
[00:23:11] >> Yeah. I do now at this uh size of the
[00:23:13] company. Um we are of course going into
[00:23:17] longer time horizons sometime.
[00:23:19] >> Yeah, I think it's just hard to plan
[00:23:21] more than six months right now with all
[00:23:22] the underlying platform changes. Um I
[00:23:26] can't Yeah, it's an interesting time to
[00:23:27] be a CEO. How about over at 11 Labs like
[00:23:29] what's the cycle?
[00:23:31] >> The cycle so we do um so the teams have
[00:23:34] a pretty high flexibility in how they
[00:23:36] operate week to week. So they can kind
[00:23:38] of take different directions but on a
[00:23:40] quarterly basis we'll we'll get the
[00:23:42] teams together. They'll spend up to a
[00:23:44] day effectively outlining what are the
[00:23:46] initiatives they want to run for the
[00:23:47] next quarter and then it's even less for
[00:23:50] the team itself. Sometimes it helps
[00:23:51] formalize a lot of the ideas but it's
[00:23:53] more valuable for the teams around so
[00:23:55] they know what to expect so they can
[00:23:56] learn from that that process. and we
[00:23:59] just came back from from an offsite with
[00:24:00] the entire team uh where we where we are
[00:24:03] looking like what where we would like to
[00:24:05] be as a company in 2026 and in the next
[00:24:08] three years. Uh the thing that's
[00:24:09] probably the hardest is research. So we
[00:24:11] do also the foundational part for for
[00:24:13] voice. Yeah. Um have a lot of research
[00:24:16] teams that that that uh that crank up
[00:24:18] some of the best models out there and
[00:24:20] that's of course so hard to predict. So
[00:24:22] here we don't give any timelines. We do
[00:24:24] research initiatives we want to plan. So
[00:24:26] that's the one that goes out of the
[00:24:28] cycle. These are like
[00:24:29] >> you don't know what's going to come out.
[00:24:30] It's very different than
[00:24:31] >> you don't know. You need to stay nimble
[00:24:33] that like the moment it comes out.
[00:24:34] That's why the small teams have been
[00:24:36] helped so much as well because the
[00:24:38] moment something comes out either
[00:24:39] internally from our research team or
[00:24:41] from other teams, you know that this is
[00:24:43] like you have 24 hours to start
[00:24:45] integrating that into your product.
[00:24:47] That's like the most important time to
[00:24:49] really to really be ahead.
[00:24:50] >> Okay. Speaking of planning, I remember
[00:24:52] in the early days of HubSpot before we
[00:24:54] were CRM, we were a marketing app.
[00:24:56] [snorts] And every year I would go to
[00:24:58] the Salesforce.com conference called
[00:25:00] Dreamforce and I sit in the audience and
[00:25:03] our pitch by the way at that time was
[00:25:05] Salesforce.com is to sales as HubSpot is
[00:25:08] to marketing. And we would always think
[00:25:10] in the back of our head until
[00:25:11] Salesforce.com wants to become the
[00:25:13] Salesforce.com marketing. And so we'd
[00:25:15] sit in the audience every year hoping
[00:25:16] [snorts]
[00:25:17] they didn't announce a marketing
[00:25:19] product. And sure enough, 2012 was their
[00:25:22] that was the marketing year. They bought
[00:25:24] four marketing companies and they really
[00:25:26] went for it. We ended up pivoting and
[00:25:28] going to CRM. I would imagine you have a
[00:25:31] similar feeling when Anthropics doing a
[00:25:33] big announcement or OpenAI's having a
[00:25:35] big announcement. Even HubSpot is like
[00:25:37] we don't know is OpenAI going to be a
[00:25:39] platform company like Google was or are
[00:25:41] they going to go build vertical apps?
[00:25:43] Are you as paranoid as I was or are you
[00:25:46] not that worried? Yeah, I mean they do
[00:25:49] have a lot of distribution out of the
[00:25:51] box. Uh so that's it would hurt if
[00:25:56] >> are you or do you sit there like worried
[00:25:58] when [snorts] they're doing their
[00:25:59] announcements? Are they going to
[00:26:00] >> not really know like I have so many
[00:26:02] things to think about. Um I catch up on
[00:26:04] like on the recent announcement and I'm
[00:26:06] I'm sure they will announce something.
[00:26:09] >> I would imagine they
[00:26:11] will be inferior. a
[00:26:13] >> you've got a head start and
[00:26:15] >> but you kind of like I kind of think it
[00:26:17] would be an obvious thing for them to
[00:26:18] build.
[00:26:18] >> Yeah.
[00:26:19] >> You know something yet like there what
[00:26:22] we're building is this full platform
[00:26:24] where you serving like most of the
[00:26:27] product needs for product anti-product
[00:26:29] engineering organization and that uh
[00:26:31] takes a lot of iteration steps to get to
[00:26:33] the to the full thing and uh
[00:26:36] >> unless they're like building that out
[00:26:37] completely in the dark and then
[00:26:39] launching it I don't think there it's
[00:26:40] going to be a threat from the first
[00:26:42] launch. Okay. I'm very impressed with
[00:26:43] your lack of paranoia. Are you paran I
[00:26:45] would are anyway are you like I was
[00:26:47] paranoid nervous about what's going to
[00:26:49] happen.
[00:26:50] >> Definitely a little always nervous and
[00:26:51] watching closely I mean they have great
[00:26:53] great research teams. So so they they
[00:26:55] they we know that they will be pushing
[00:26:57] into the voice space. Yes. Um at the at
[00:27:00] the same time given like the spread of
[00:27:02] work that you just mentioned the corlary
[00:27:05] is they lack focus and we are fully
[00:27:07] focused on voice whether that's creating
[00:27:09] the research or products for creating
[00:27:11] voice agent or creating creative
[00:27:13] workflows which does take a lot of
[00:27:15] iterations to actually bring that to the
[00:27:17] user to make it the best experience that
[00:27:19] they require to solve their problems
[00:27:21] solve their integrations so I do think
[00:27:23] it's uh you know it's it's it's going to
[00:27:26] become increasingly competitive
[00:27:27] especially on the research But that's
[00:27:29] where the product platform brand the
[00:27:32] design the taste will matter a lot more.
[00:27:34] Something we speak a little bit with
[00:27:35] Anton every so often and that will be
[00:27:38] the big piece where companies going deep
[00:27:41] into that space will will win.
[00:27:42] >> Okay. Speaking of taste, one thing I
[00:27:45] really like about both of you is I think
[00:27:47] you have taste particularly in your
[00:27:49] marketing. Like you guys do some
[00:27:51] interesting stuff. You are fantastic on
[00:27:54] Twitter. [laughter] Fantastic on
[00:27:56] Twitter. You're one of my favorite
[00:27:57] follows.
[00:27:58] How much time are you spending doing it?
[00:28:00] Do you do it all yourself? Uh
[00:28:04] you're you're you're out there on stuff.
[00:28:07] Like just talk about your Twitter
[00:28:09] strategy.
[00:28:09] >> Yeah, sure.
[00:28:10] >> Um
[00:28:11] >> did you like did you tweet just before
[00:28:12] we got in here? Like what's the deal?
[00:28:15] >> No, but um I I do spend quite some time
[00:28:18] on it and it feels like oh my god, I'm
[00:28:20] doing so many there. I'm a CEO. I'm
[00:28:22] doing so many things and then I have to
[00:28:23] sit down every week and and get some of
[00:28:25] this some of the post right. Um, but I
[00:28:28] do have a team that comes to me with
[00:28:30] ideas and like every Monday we go
[00:28:32] through it's it's 15 minutes in the
[00:28:33] calendar. Okay. Usually takes more time.
[00:28:36] >> They bring you here's a tweet that would
[00:28:37] be good.
[00:28:37] >> No, they bring me ideas like okay should
[00:28:40] we do something on this and I I like
[00:28:41] drop a lot of um ideas as well in the
[00:28:44] Slack channel and uh um but this is not
[00:28:47] their full-time job either. So it's it's
[00:28:49] a bit it's it's like it's not a proper
[00:28:52] function in the company.
[00:28:54] >> It's very very effective in my opinion.
[00:28:56] like your brand is very strong. It
[00:28:59] >> is it working really well? Are you
[00:29:01] actually pressing the button when the
[00:29:03] tweak goes out or is somebody doing it
[00:29:04] for you?
[00:29:05] >> It's usually me. I I So there there's an
[00:29:09] actually a very good company called the
[00:29:11] typefully that you can draft them in and
[00:29:13] then you can like collaborate on them.
[00:29:15] Okay.
[00:29:15] >> Uh and I I usually the one who schedule
[00:29:18] them in that. Okay.
[00:29:20] >> So I do the final process.
[00:29:21] >> I would keep going and get even whackier
[00:29:22] if I were you. [laughter]
[00:29:24] >> Thank you.
[00:29:25] >> I think you're killing it.
[00:29:27] >> You guys um are busy. I remember when I
[00:29:31] was your size
[00:29:33] um I get I got asked to do so much
[00:29:37] Speak at my conference. Can you
[00:29:39] interview my daughter? Can you talk to
[00:29:41] this venture capitalist, this candidate?
[00:29:44] It's just an endless like
[00:29:47] of [snorts] asks and it's chaotic and
[00:29:50] the firm is asking you to do all that
[00:29:52] kind of stuff. How do you guys manage
[00:29:55] just like kind of tactically manage the
[00:29:57] chaos, manage your schedule, get
[00:30:00] done in the in the hurricane of of
[00:30:04] requests, inputs, chaos? Any tricks?
[00:30:08] >> A few few tricks. Few tricks for sure.
[00:30:10] The the I think the we we run a lot of
[00:30:13] the company on Slack. So the Slack is
[00:30:15] one part and of course the email is
[00:30:16] especially the external piece for email.
[00:30:18] Uh now it's a combination of two. uh my
[00:30:21] my brilliant assistant Hana is helping
[00:30:23] and the script is helping to autocl
[00:30:25] classify a lot of emails to effectively
[00:30:27] P 0 P1 P2 P 0 is
[00:30:30] >> somebody else is reading your emails and
[00:30:31] P 0
[00:30:32] >> someone else is reading and now we have
[00:30:33] a script as well to autocl classify them
[00:30:35] >> okay
[00:30:36] >> and uh and then P 0 is
[00:30:38] >> that is interesting
[00:30:38] >> it's super helpful
[00:30:39] >> okay
[00:30:40] >> same day reply on the P 0 P1 can wait
[00:30:42] through the week P2 not important I can
[00:30:45] I can I I can take out and then I have
[00:30:47] like unblock piece
[00:30:48] >> so somebody's reading your emails tells
[00:30:50] us like hey you need to respond to this
[00:30:51] is P 0
[00:30:52] >> labels so every email gets a label and
[00:30:55] then
[00:30:55] >> by a homo sapien
[00:30:56] >> by a homo sapiens and a script so now
[00:30:59] it's a combination of both so script
[00:31:01] does the first pass and then the homo
[00:31:03] sapiens does the second second pass
[00:31:05] >> fascinating
[00:31:06] >> hana who is like great at it too okay
[00:31:08] >> and um and then you know exactly okay
[00:31:11] this is I need to reply this day this is
[00:31:13] an important customer partner
[00:31:14] >> how does she know what's important like
[00:31:17] I send you an email she must be like
[00:31:19] that's It's so important. You got to
[00:31:21] respond. [laughter]
[00:31:23] How does she know what's important?
[00:31:24] >> Well, the the the first thing is
[00:31:26] sometimes there's of course new where
[00:31:27] you don't, but usually she knows me
[00:31:29] inside out. And the second thing is for
[00:31:30] a lot of the people, a lot of the
[00:31:32] clients, you Brian, you will be in my
[00:31:34] contact list, you will have a P 0
[00:31:36] inbound. So the first moment you hit me
[00:31:38] with the email, it will autocl classify
[00:31:40] that as a P 0. Um, so I know that it's
[00:31:42] at the top and uh and that I should
[00:31:44] reply on the on the same day.
[00:31:46] >> Okay. Um, so that has worked
[00:31:47] tremendously across across email. I get
[00:31:50] I think I'm I'm very good on like
[00:31:52] getting up um the Slack must be a
[00:31:55] firestorm.
[00:31:55] >> Slack is a firestorm. Slack is a
[00:31:57] firestorm. Um, so it's usually a
[00:32:00] combination. If I think it's taking more
[00:32:02] than five minutes, then I will remind
[00:32:04] myself later. So I'm big on the remind
[00:32:06] function.
[00:32:07] >> And then if it's less than five minutes,
[00:32:09] I usually try to to reply straight away.
[00:32:11] >> Yeah. Kind of inbox zero on your Slack.
[00:32:13] >> Inbox zero on the Slack.
[00:32:14] >> Okay. What about your calendar?
[00:32:17] >> Calendar is uh at least week in advance
[00:32:21] clean in terms of like what I want to do
[00:32:23] and then if there's like an urgent thing
[00:32:25] that comes up then it things get
[00:32:26] reshuffled.
[00:32:27] >> Yeah.
[00:32:28] >> Um and then as I think the biggest piece
[00:32:31] that I've done over the last six months
[00:32:32] and you mentioned the conferences, the
[00:32:34] events is planning at least a quarter
[00:32:36] ahead which uh which continents I will
[00:32:39] be in and I'm trying to never be
[00:32:42] switching the continent in a in the same
[00:32:44] month. So like I with 10 a month I'm
[00:32:45] trying to stay in one place.
[00:32:47] >> Oh, so you go to the US for a month.
[00:32:49] >> I usually try to be in the US for close
[00:32:51] to a month.
[00:32:52] >> I see.
[00:32:52] >> And that helps a lot with getting on the
[00:32:55] ground working with the team but also
[00:32:56] working with the customers. I think it's
[00:32:58] going to decrease to two weeks now given
[00:33:00] how how distributed we are. But uh but
[00:33:03] before that I used to go for like few
[00:33:05] days sometimes to us and that has that
[00:33:09] has been not not ideal. Yeah. Before
[00:33:12] >> Okay. Your calendar must be nuts. Um,
[00:33:16] what does it look like and where do you
[00:33:18] build in time to like actually think?
[00:33:22] >> It's a good question. Um,
[00:33:26] I kind of I think I think best by
[00:33:28] talking with together with someone else.
[00:33:30] >> Okay.
[00:33:31] >> Um, so it it naturally like happens. I
[00:33:34] see
[00:33:34] >> maybe late in the office or something
[00:33:36] with grabbing oneonone time.
[00:33:38] >> Um, yeah. I I think I'm like I'm still
[00:33:41] in this like firestorm and I I'm going
[00:33:45] set on innovating on what works best.
[00:33:47] Like there's a certain type of
[00:33:50] creativity that you also only get like
[00:33:52] when you're bored or like you get some
[00:33:54] downtime and uh I don't I think there's
[00:33:57] some way to program myself with the like
[00:33:59] this environment to get more of that.
[00:34:02] >> I did a Wednesday every Wednesday I work
[00:34:04] from home
[00:34:04] >> and no meeting it was no meeting
[00:34:06] Wednesday. That helped. I'm also a
[00:34:08] little introverted so I needed a little
[00:34:10] time to re charge. Are you guys
[00:34:11] introverted or extroverted?
[00:34:13] >> Are you introverted?
[00:34:14] >> Um I say that but people around me are
[00:34:16] like no no you're fake introverts.
[00:34:18] >> Yeah. [laughter]
[00:34:19] >> Yeah.
[00:34:19] >> But I I mean if I if I'm alone a full
[00:34:21] day I'm like oh god people human coming.
[00:34:24] >> I'm not like that. I'm like oh I need
[00:34:25] another alone day. Um okay interesting.
[00:34:29] >> The no meetings day helps. We I I also
[00:34:32] have no meetings day. it usually gets
[00:34:34] meetings, but they are meetings I
[00:34:35] actually want to do rather than like are
[00:34:38] um like kind of proactive for the future
[00:34:40] rather than like in the moment in this
[00:34:42] given week. So,
[00:34:42] >> one of the things that really helped me
[00:34:44] was like once a month I made a to-do
[00:34:45] list of like here's the eight things I
[00:34:47] want to get done and I would publish
[00:34:50] that on our we had a wiki at the time
[00:34:52] and so everyone in the company to see
[00:34:54] what I was working on and I would look
[00:34:56] at it every couple days and be like does
[00:34:58] my calendar match my to-do list because
[00:35:00] all the Slacks and emails are everybody
[00:35:02] else's priorities imposed on you and by
[00:35:05] putting it on there it sort of allowed
[00:35:08] me to say no. Um, it's just so much
[00:35:12] stuff and it was hard to say no. And so
[00:35:15] it gave me license to say, you know,
[00:35:17] it's not on my to-do list. I'm not going
[00:35:18] to do it. And then I got a hat with a
[00:35:21] big no on it, a no hat, and I walk
[00:35:23] around the office uh and people call me
[00:35:25] Dr. No. Because I just wanted to keep it
[00:35:27] focused on a couple things that I was
[00:35:29] trying to get done and the company was
[00:35:30] trying to get done and I would lose
[00:35:32] focus and then it' be a firestorm and
[00:35:34] then back. So I didn't nail it, but that
[00:35:36] was a small hack that helped a little.
[00:35:39] Okay, you two um are
[00:35:42] do an amazing job building amazing
[00:35:43] companies in Europe. My two favorite
[00:35:45] entrepreneurs. Um
[00:35:48] what's it like building an amazing AI
[00:35:50] company in Europe? Um
[00:35:53] and what are the pluses and minuses of
[00:35:56] building in Europe?
[00:35:57] >> I I think um the network around you is
[00:36:02] not as mature compared to especially
[00:36:04] Silicon Valley.
[00:36:05] >> Yeah. And that makes it more difficult
[00:36:08] with the distribution. Um I mean in like
[00:36:13] sophisticated investors
[00:36:16] are like just one coffee away can be
[00:36:18] valuable. Uh and then once you're
[00:36:22] staffing especially on like not the high
[00:36:25] slope generalists are distributed across
[00:36:27] the world, right? But as you're stuffing
[00:36:29] with people who have done it and seen it
[00:36:30] before, um it's trickier to find it in
[00:36:34] Europe, I would say. But
[00:36:37] >> I heard you refer to building in Europe
[00:36:39] as hard mode.
[00:36:40] >> I mean that those parts are hard mode.
[00:36:41] But at the same time, I I think
[00:36:44] >> uh I don't know, maybe we would have
[00:36:46] been more successful building from from
[00:36:48] the valley or something. I could have
[00:36:49] see that. But I think it has been very
[00:36:52] helpful for us to be like the go-to
[00:36:55] number one talent destination in
[00:36:57] Stockholm.
[00:36:58] >> Uh and that's the reason I decided no,
[00:37:00] we're going to stay here. We're going to
[00:37:02] stay here and bet on on the that there's
[00:37:04] much more available talent that doesn't
[00:37:06] jump around and like they aren't
[00:37:08] entitled and spoiled and they they're
[00:37:12] cheaper. They're they're yearning for um
[00:37:14] like a possibility to literally change
[00:37:17] the world.
[00:37:18] >> Yeah. And um there's not many companies
[00:37:21] that have done it from Europe. There has
[00:37:23] not not been a trillion dollar company
[00:37:24] from Europe. And uh being at 11 Labs or
[00:37:27] building at lovable is one of those
[00:37:29] opport very very rare opportunities
[00:37:30] here.
[00:37:31] >> I agree with that. I'm going to ask you
[00:37:32] this. You've got employees in the US and
[00:37:34] Europe.
[00:37:36] Any difference?
[00:37:39] >> Definitely differences. And similar I I
[00:37:41] I will quickly add that I think the
[00:37:43] talent in Europe can be incredible.
[00:37:45] Okay.
[00:37:45] >> You just need to you need to find you
[00:37:47] need to find that talent.
[00:37:48] >> Um
[00:37:48] >> and we're you're building in London
[00:37:50] mostly or all over?
[00:37:51] >> Uh all over, but London and Poland are
[00:37:53] our biggest hubs. And
[00:37:55] >> Poland must be terrific.
[00:37:56] >> Poland is is incredible. Like some of
[00:37:58] the best central Eastern Europe like
[00:37:59] some of
[00:38:00] >> everybody must want to work for you in
[00:38:01] Poland. It's like it's like Anton Stock.
[00:38:02] >> We are we are heavily building the brand
[00:38:04] across across Eastern Europe and and we
[00:38:06] we think those engineers are just so
[00:38:07] incredible. They are yearning for
[00:38:09] something. I think they're yearning for
[00:38:10] a company that actually wants to build
[00:38:12] something generational, something big.
[00:38:14] And there's just so few of those
[00:38:15] opportunities. At the same time, the
[00:38:17] companies of Silicon Valley frequently
[00:38:18] don't give that opportunity. So it's
[00:38:20] like perfect
[00:38:21] >> to build new stuff. They give like
[00:38:23] >> exactly
[00:38:23] >> it stuff.
[00:38:24] >> Uh and on so I think one of the
[00:38:26] differences which is on a lot of
[00:38:29] Europeans especially Eastern Europe is
[00:38:31] are very straightforward, straight to
[00:38:32] the point, very direct sometimes
[00:38:35] >> uh sometimes too direct which we
[00:38:37] actually really enjoy as a company. it
[00:38:39] helped to share a lot of ideas,
[00:38:41] criticism, feedback in a in a much
[00:38:43] better way. Um, on the other hand, what
[00:38:46] I think US is going for them is that
[00:38:47] confidence of like things are going to
[00:38:50] be amazing, are great, are very
[00:38:51] ambitious across the entirety of of of
[00:38:54] the people. And that's something that uh
[00:38:56] that we are continuously trying to
[00:38:58] instill in some of the people across
[00:39:00] across Europe.
[00:39:00] >> Okay. too. Um, and maybe the other thing
[00:39:02] that helps across Europe is that if
[00:39:04] you're building in Europe, um, you of
[00:39:06] course need to build for for the global
[00:39:08] market. You cannot build just for
[00:39:09] European market.
[00:39:10] >> But then when you do that, then you the
[00:39:12] time zone is actually perfect for
[00:39:14] catering to US to to to
[00:39:17] South America to Europe and to Asia as
[00:39:19] well, which helped in our case as well.
[00:39:21] >> And the difference between American
[00:39:23] employees and European
[00:39:25] >> it would be that I think the the main
[00:39:26] one is also beyond being direct and
[00:39:29] confident. I think the um
[00:39:31] entrepreneurship kind of aspiration is
[00:39:34] very different in US. Everybody knows
[00:39:36] value of equity. Everybody is treating
[00:39:38] that as part of like a good career. In
[00:39:41] Europe, you kind of need to convince the
[00:39:42] employees. Sometimes you need to
[00:39:43] convince the families that this is the
[00:39:45] right thing.
[00:39:45] >> Uh in Poland, we need to uh frequently
[00:39:48] explain that equity is worth something.
[00:39:51] Almost force the employees to take the
[00:39:52] equity, which which is always an
[00:39:55] interesting surprise of like how does it
[00:39:57] work? Um but now we've went through this
[00:39:59] cycle a few times. Um and the equity is
[00:40:02] worth something with the tender offers.
[00:40:03] So people started educating other people
[00:40:05] that this is actually the right choice
[00:40:08] uh which we hope will like in places
[00:40:10] like Poland and wider Europe will become
[00:40:12] more more normalized and and then
[00:40:14] something that people will will want to
[00:40:16] do across entrepreneurship.
[00:40:17] >> When I was in my late 20s I spent in
[00:40:21] early 30s seven years in Asia and I
[00:40:24] worked for this company PTC a very good
[00:40:26] company in the US.
[00:40:28] And I had to convince Japanese people
[00:40:30] and Chinese people and Korean people
[00:40:31] that this thing called equity is going
[00:40:33] to be worth a lot. And man, it was a dog
[00:40:35] fight convincing them like what this is
[00:40:37] you're just trying to pay me less money.
[00:40:39] Um I remember those days. Um and people
[00:40:42] made a lot of money on that stock.
[00:40:45] Okay. On this topic like 996 are you
[00:40:49] guys in office 996 hardcore? Like one
[00:40:53] interesting thing like my generation of
[00:40:55] CEOs, we kind of followed it. Steve Jobs
[00:40:58] was sort of on our Mount Rushmore and
[00:41:01] the current generation's it feels like
[00:41:03] it's a lot more Elon and and companies
[00:41:05] are working much more like Elon's
[00:41:07] companies. Who's your Mount Rushmore?
[00:41:09] Are you 996 like Elon Plus? Like where
[00:41:13] where are you guys at?
[00:41:14] >> Steve Jobs is great. Yeah.
[00:41:15] >> Yeah. I think it's a good one.
[00:41:16] [laughter] I mean, what I like about him
[00:41:18] is he really understands that like a
[00:41:20] team working better and better and
[00:41:22] better over time and like really
[00:41:24] obsessing and caring about what you're
[00:41:26] doing is what
[00:41:26] >> Who are you talking about?
[00:41:27] >> Steve Jobs. Yes.
[00:41:29] >> But who who if I'm Steve Jobs, who are
[00:41:31] you Elon? Who's your
[00:41:33] >> um I mean my style can be a bit Elon
[00:41:36] like this has to get done now. Like what
[00:41:39] what does it take to do this faster?
[00:41:40] What
[00:41:40] >> is it Daniel?
[00:41:42] >> No, I don't know him that well
[00:41:43] unfortunately how he operated. But uh uh
[00:41:46] so based on reading about Elon um I have
[00:41:49] a bit of that but I think you lose a lot
[00:41:51] of the like the autonomy and teams
[00:41:54] feeling ownership of doing doing it too
[00:41:57] much the Elon way. So uh I I might get
[00:42:01] back to you on with a with a more care.
[00:42:03] >> Are you 996 plus?
[00:42:05] >> Um me many people are in the company are
[00:42:07] 996 plus many people in the company but
[00:42:10] um people have family as families as
[00:42:12] well. So it's just we have very very
[00:42:15] very high expectations of everyone to
[00:42:17] have to drive impact.
[00:42:19] >> Um and then if you're not working many
[00:42:22] hours you need to have clearly
[00:42:26] [laughter] clearly have impact in other
[00:42:27] ways. You think that scales like one of
[00:42:29] the problems with scale is that drive
[00:42:32] sort of waines and that you know do you
[00:42:35] think that fades and is there ideas in
[00:42:37] your head how you keep that that
[00:42:40] motivation going?
[00:42:42] >> Um
[00:42:44] I I think it's about setting very very
[00:42:46] ambitious goals every week and um
[00:42:49] >> that's one of your things every week you
[00:42:51] put out goals.
[00:42:52] >> Yeah. And then it's it's very being very
[00:42:55] clear before someone joins on what the
[00:42:57] expectations are
[00:42:58] >> and um it's about
[00:43:02] evaluating impact
[00:43:03] >> and have you lost candidates like VP
[00:43:06] candidates because like you know what
[00:43:08] yeah I love the mission I love you but I
[00:43:12] can only do 50 hours a week and I got a
[00:43:15] I've got a I've got a life I've got four
[00:43:17] kids. I I lost I think we lost some kind
[00:43:20] of like that but that's maybe good.
[00:43:22] >> Life in the big city. Okay. How how
[00:43:25] who's your Mount Rushmore?
[00:43:28] >> It's definitely closer to Steve Jobs
[00:43:30] between those two. Um uh but it's it's
[00:43:33] his he was always like so caring about
[00:43:34] the design about making it kind of
[00:43:38] hiding complexity from the user making
[00:43:40] it easy to use. Um, uh, he does he does
[00:43:43] have this obsessive piece which is maybe
[00:43:45] a slightly different to how I would try
[00:43:47] to to run it or or or work in a company.
[00:43:50] Uh, but I love what he created as as as
[00:43:52] his legacy. But there are amazing other
[00:43:54] CEOs there. You know, there's like more
[00:43:56] more pockets from different people that
[00:43:58] that that are incredible. I like Jamie
[00:44:00] Diamond and how his clarity and and his
[00:44:03] like across so many things that he runs
[00:44:06] and he I think he has like half a
[00:44:07] million people under him. He feels very
[00:44:09] calm and under control. I think this is
[00:44:11] admirable. Um, Satya, I think the way he
[00:44:15] kind of turned it around and he is like
[00:44:17] a very caring person around around uh
[00:44:19] how he runs the company. I think this
[00:44:21] this is this is another great great
[00:44:24] leader. Um,
[00:44:26] but from the 996 I think in our case,
[00:44:29] >> are you guys 996?
[00:44:31] >> Not in the office. I think everybody is
[00:44:33] online chronically and all the time. We
[00:44:36] definitely make it very explicit before
[00:44:37] you you join. It's we find it's like
[00:44:40] once in a in a lifetime change with AI
[00:44:43] across the world we can be the voice of
[00:44:45] the change the voice of the technology
[00:44:46] and everybody understands the
[00:44:48] opportunity ahead is is rare um
[00:44:50] >> and we do lose candidates across but
[00:44:52] then you filter we do frequently I mean
[00:44:55] they frequently won't I think even apply
[00:44:57] we are like very vocal in the process
[00:44:59] that that that it's it's it's a it's a
[00:45:01] lot of time commitment we never impose
[00:45:03] it or ask anyone for doing that but they
[00:45:06] do Um it's it's usually seven days a
[00:45:10] week but you are not maybe working all
[00:45:12] the seven days a week but you are online
[00:45:14] and ready to jump in especially on the
[00:45:16] weekends on any on any questions and um
[00:45:20] and I think people people enjoy working
[00:45:23] next to passionate people so you kind of
[00:45:25] like get that bar higher you run
[00:45:28] together and then when you see results
[00:45:29] it's it's also motivating
[00:45:30] >> in like the last 50 employees like your
[00:45:33] from employee 250 to 500 versus 50 to
[00:45:36] 100 is Is there a difference in your
[00:45:38] mind in commitment and zeal and
[00:45:42] whatever?
[00:45:43] >> You know it's definitely some but but
[00:45:45] the current employees are also okay on
[00:45:47] it like and I think the small teams
[00:45:49] helped where you you have like you know
[00:45:51] you effectively join that
[00:45:53] >> unit of 10 people or less.
[00:45:55] >> So you are seeing that everybody's
[00:45:57] running in that unit and everybody else
[00:45:59] is running too. So you you are going
[00:46:01] after after that too. Um, of course we
[00:46:04] also have people with families, people
[00:46:06] that will have other other things and
[00:46:07] and that can work and uh and and and it
[00:46:10] does, but usually those people are are
[00:46:12] thinking about work and how to improve
[00:46:15] um at all times.
[00:46:16] >> What do you guys think European like
[00:46:18] what needs to happen in Europe to
[00:46:20] [applause] to have like a lot more of
[00:46:23] you guys?
[00:46:25] >> I think they're coming. Yeah, it truly
[00:46:27] is 100%. Okay. There there is like
[00:46:29] engineering schools now you ask them
[00:46:31] would you consider starting a startup or
[00:46:33] being in part of the funding team 80%
[00:46:36] yes
[00:46:36] >> okay
[00:46:37] >> it went up to 10x
[00:46:40] okay interesting
[00:46:40] >> and that first generation will help I
[00:46:42] think like few of the companies if we if
[00:46:44] we do do a good job get get some people
[00:46:47] to to start another set of companies I
[00:46:49] think the second thing of what's I think
[00:46:51] missing in the European ecosystem is
[00:46:53] people that have done it before have
[00:46:54] seen that scale um that and then of is
[00:46:58] have got a good outcome to then make
[00:47:00] make clear of like this is actually a
[00:47:01] really cool thing to do. Uh hopefully
[00:47:03] those people can infuse additional set
[00:47:05] of startups across across Europe.
[00:47:07] >> We started um HubSpot in Boston and it's
[00:47:12] got a lot of the same benefits Europe
[00:47:13] like so much talent MIT's there just we
[00:47:16] were a magnet for it. the the area it
[00:47:19] fell down is as we scaled and we need to
[00:47:21] hire you know a head of marketing who
[00:47:23] had seen the movie before someone who
[00:47:25] had really operated at scale so we
[00:47:28] started hiring more people in the valley
[00:47:30] um that started happen around a thousand
[00:47:32] employees um
[00:47:33] >> but it feels similar Boston feels
[00:47:35] similar to Europe in that way Boston's
[00:47:37] conservative it's kind of similar um any
[00:47:41] advice for all there's lots of young
[00:47:43] smart entrepreneurs listen to this pod
[00:47:46] uh that want to build the next levelable
[00:47:48] the next 11 labs. Any any any advice?
[00:47:51] >> First of all, I think go for it. It's
[00:47:53] it's amazing to to to build a company
[00:47:56] and you know, of course, um maybe I was
[00:47:58] in a in a lucky position where where I
[00:48:01] had savings and I could I didn't have
[00:48:02] like the the dependencies, but if you
[00:48:04] are in that similar situation, uh I
[00:48:06] think it's it's go for it. the learning
[00:48:08] experience you get uh across building a
[00:48:11] company even if it doesn't go the way
[00:48:13] what you expect I think is so much more
[00:48:15] valuable than uh than frequently joining
[00:48:17] joining other companies and being a
[00:48:18] smaller cogle in a big machine um and
[00:48:21] then I think obsess about the problem
[00:48:23] try to deeply understand what you are
[00:48:24] actually solving for talk with customers
[00:48:26] and the the simplest advice I think is
[00:48:28] the most valuable here which is actually
[00:48:30] working with the user and iterating very
[00:48:32] very deeply um and then I think it's all
[00:48:35] about the team and hiring so the people
[00:48:36] you bring across
[00:48:38] and who you build with will be will be
[00:48:40] defining for the company. So pick your
[00:48:42] co-founders carefully and well and know
[00:48:45] them ideally for a longer time before
[00:48:47] you decide to start something. And as
[00:48:49] you assemble the team, you really want
[00:48:50] the trusted individuals that
[00:48:52] >> uh that you want to go for the for the
[00:48:54] next decades together.
[00:48:55] >> Yeah.
[00:48:57] >> I think you want to learn things very
[00:48:59] very fast if you're getting started and
[00:49:03] um you want to learn a lot of things.
[00:49:04] You want to learn how to hire. Um I mean
[00:49:07] you don't have to be so good at managing
[00:49:08] but having high expectations of people
[00:49:10] and giving them clear feedback
[00:49:12] [clears throat]
[00:49:12] >> and you want to know learn how to sell.
[00:49:15] you want to sell to your customers or
[00:49:17] sell them or and market um to your the
[00:49:21] people you want to hire and if you want
[00:49:23] investors you're always selling and so
[00:49:25] you should do that all the time and fail
[00:49:27] and uh ask someone who you respect to
[00:49:30] >> give it to you hard on like how bad you
[00:49:32] are because if you're just getting
[00:49:34] started
[00:49:34] >> first
[00:49:35] >> yeah of course [laughter]
[00:49:37] >> okay
[00:49:38] >> next person and just go out there and
[00:49:42] like try to find joy probably by having
[00:49:46] a co-founder as you're talking about in
[00:49:47] the in the failings and the learnings.
[00:49:49] >> Yes.
[00:49:49] >> Yeah. That's the other thing which uh I
[00:49:51] was thinking about your earlier question
[00:49:53] what you don't expect as a CEO as well.
[00:49:55] Um you don't expect that uh that you
[00:49:57] don't have anyone to complain to
[00:49:58] effectively,
[00:49:59] >> right? [laughter]
[00:50:00] >> So so your co-founder is your like
[00:50:02] soulmate that you can speak through and
[00:50:04] then there are some sometimes amazing
[00:50:05] people in the team you can iterate
[00:50:07] through but not to the same not to the
[00:50:09] same.
[00:50:09] >> Yes, I totally totally agree with that.
[00:50:12] Um I want to congratulate you guys on
[00:50:14] all your success. I admire what you guys
[00:50:15] are doing. I sure hope you guys build
[00:50:18] trillion dollar companies in Europe.
[00:50:20] That'd be amazing. Good luck to you.
[00:50:21] Thanks for doing the pod.
[00:50:23] >> Thank you so much.
[00:50:23] >> Thank you.
[00:50:24] >> Appreciate you.
[00:50:25] >> Thank you.
[00:50:25] >> Yeah.
[00:50:26] >> Okay. Those two are terrific and it's
[00:50:28] nice to see them kind of blossoming
[00:50:31] before our eyes. What they have in
[00:50:33] common is they both had like seven or
[00:50:35] eight years of experience with like one
[00:50:38] good company in there. And I know it's
[00:50:40] fashionable to drop out of Harvard and
[00:50:42] start a company like Zuck did, but at
[00:50:44] least for me,
[00:50:47] I did two startups before HubSpot. One
[00:50:50] was very successful, went public, and
[00:50:52] got very large. Man, did I learn a lot
[00:50:54] from that. And man, are there a lot of
[00:50:56] lessons inside of HubSpot about scaling,
[00:50:58] but you do you. But I don't think it
[00:51:00] hurts a founder to be in a really good
[00:51:02] startup to learn before they start a
[00:51:04] company. They talked a lot about their
[00:51:06] co-founders
[00:51:08] and one of the things about being a CEO
[00:51:10] is you're just you're you're a
[00:51:12] umbrella. Like all the rains on you
[00:51:15] and you get an umbrella for your whole
[00:51:16] organization. It's hard. The other thing
[00:51:19] about being a CEO is like no one is
[00:51:22] coming to save you. In my startups, my
[00:51:24] boss would come and save me. Another
[00:51:26] team would come and save me. There was a
[00:51:28] lot of resources around. You're pretty
[00:51:30] alone and it's on you as a founder. The
[00:51:33] one person you can complain to is your
[00:51:35] co-founder. And so my advice to to you
[00:51:38] would be to really get to know your
[00:51:40] co-founder because it's an incredibly
[00:51:42] important relationship for you going
[00:51:44] forward. We got into mechanics of of the
[00:51:46] job and we talked about delegation and
[00:51:49] they're kind of starting to it's
[00:51:51] interesting. They're starting to
[00:51:52] delegate. They're like, "Oh, we're kind
[00:51:55] of founder mode. We're not sure how to
[00:51:56] do this." But they're starting to do it.
[00:51:57] It's impressive to see what they're
[00:51:58] doing. my experience the way that worked
[00:52:01] as HubSpot scaled. I was very founder
[00:52:05] mode in sales and in product and man the
[00:52:08] rest of the organization I was very
[00:52:10] manager mode and I drove both
[00:52:12] constituencies crazy. The the sales and
[00:52:15] product folks I was in their shorts and
[00:52:17] they always complained I was too much in
[00:52:19] the details. All the rest of them
[00:52:21] complained that they didn't respond to
[00:52:22] their emails. So that was sort of the
[00:52:23] blend for me. I wasn't all manager mode.
[00:52:25] It wasn't all founder mode and that kind
[00:52:28] of worked for me and m maybe that would
[00:52:29] work for you running your company. I
[00:52:31] like the way they were thinking about
[00:52:32] their teams. I asked all the CEOs on
[00:52:35] these uh episodes know what's their span
[00:52:38] of control and it's all over the map. I
[00:52:41] by the way I thought everyone was
[00:52:42] copying um Jason Huang and having 60
[00:52:45] direct reports. That is definitely not
[00:52:47] true. He is an N of one on that. And
[00:52:51] like Anton Helmley has five direct
[00:52:53] reports. I had 10, my tea has 15. So,
[00:52:56] it's a little bit all over the map. If I
[00:52:59] were you, I would think about that. What
[00:53:01] do you want your span of control to be?
[00:53:03] And I would have it as wide as you can
[00:53:05] tolerate. As you scale from 100 to a,000
[00:53:07] employees, all those layers in there
[00:53:09] really will slow you down. So, you want
[00:53:10] to keep it as flat as you can. The other
[00:53:13] thing I liked about that we're thinking
[00:53:14] about Teams is they were definitely
[00:53:16] starting to bring in some been there,
[00:53:18] done that people. The whole team wasn't
[00:53:20] been there, done that. The way HubSpot
[00:53:22] ended up is we had about half been there
[00:53:25] done that and half homegrown and VCs try
[00:53:27] to jam you full of been there done that.
[00:53:29] I like that balance having a little bit
[00:53:31] of both. The homegrown talent is
[00:53:33] underrated on your teams most likely. We
[00:53:35] also talked about just managing the
[00:53:37] chaos like they're growing crazy. They
[00:53:39] have so much opportunity. Um it's just a
[00:53:42] hurricane of of input coming into them.
[00:53:45] And a couple things, couple hacks I
[00:53:48] liked. Anton is really good on Twitter
[00:53:50] by the way. If you don't follow him,
[00:53:52] he's really good. I like that every
[00:53:54] Monday morning he has a 15minute meeting
[00:53:56] with a couple of his staff members and
[00:53:57] they brainstorm on tweets. So, he's not
[00:53:59] just coming up with that
[00:54:00] extemporaneously. He's thought about it
[00:54:02] a little bit and he's very good at it.
[00:54:04] Most of them, or at least I had a no
[00:54:06] meaning day where I could actually think
[00:54:08] and get some room and work on projects.
[00:54:09] I think that's a good hack. I had it on
[00:54:11] Fridays for a while. Everyone thought I
[00:54:13] was taking a long weekend. I moved it to
[00:54:14] Wednesdays. And they're going to have to
[00:54:18] get good at saying no. Like I I was
[00:54:20] working on saying no. So I made myself
[00:54:23] this hat, my no hat, and I had a no
[00:54:25] shirt, too. And I think startups are
[00:54:28] much much more likely to die of
[00:54:30] overeating and starvation. That's
[00:54:32] probably true of yours. You might need
[00:54:34] your own no hat. You know, speaking of
[00:54:37] chaos,
[00:54:38] I asked them, are they 996? And they are
[00:54:40] both 996 plus. Um, and I think that's
[00:54:45] interesting. I've asked all the CEOs
[00:54:47] I've been interviewing. and it's been 10
[00:54:49] so far and the early stage startups are
[00:54:51] all doing 996 and the bigger ones aren't
[00:54:53] and I think that's probably life in the
[00:54:55] fast lane as your employees start having
[00:54:58] families and you're hiring people with
[00:55:00] families it's just hard to get people in
[00:55:02] the office six days a week working 9 to9
[00:55:04] but I think keep it going as long as you
[00:55:06] can if you're doing 996 I think it's
[00:55:08] good I was 996 but I didn't ask my team
[00:55:11] to be 996 uh we talked a lot about
[00:55:14] Europe these are two amazing companies
[00:55:16] in Europe and Europe's So, we started in
[00:55:19] Boston. And Boston's a little bit out
[00:55:20] like Europe. You're like outside the
[00:55:22] echo chamber of um Silicon Valley. And
[00:55:27] there's some real pluses and minuses to
[00:55:29] being outside of the valley. The pluses
[00:55:31] are you end up being a very large fish
[00:55:34] in a very small pond, which can help.
[00:55:37] And you have really good access to
[00:55:40] talent and not a lot of competition for
[00:55:42] that talent. So, real pluses. Um, the
[00:55:46] minuses we found out at HubSpot and
[00:55:48] they're going to find out is inside of
[00:55:50] Boston there's just not a lot of scale
[00:55:52] tech companies. So, we had a hard time
[00:55:54] finding executives who had seen that
[00:55:56] movie on that next level of scale. Like
[00:55:58] we took a couple people from Akami and
[00:56:00] that worked out, but it was pretty lean
[00:56:02] and so we started hiring execs out in
[00:56:04] San Francisco. So, real pluses and
[00:56:06] minuses to being in a big city. If I had
[00:56:09] to do HubSpot over again, by the way,
[00:56:11] you didn't ask, but uh I would have we
[00:56:14] were in Boston, I'd have a big office in
[00:56:16] Boston, big office in San Francisco,
[00:56:18] then another big office in, I don't
[00:56:20] know, Nashville or Denver or Toronto
[00:56:22] would be pretty good where you can hire
[00:56:25] lots and lots of people for less money
[00:56:26] and have them be a little bit more loyal
[00:56:29] than, let's say, in your San Francisco
[00:56:30] office. I wouldn't let everybody work
[00:56:31] from home. I'd have [music] three big
[00:56:33] hubs. Okay, we wound up obviously
[00:56:35] talking about Europe. They're both in
[00:56:36] Europe. Really encouraging for Europe.
[00:56:38] world could use more Silicon Valleys and
[00:56:40] the world could use, you know, a vibrant
[00:56:43] European entrepreneurial scene. [music]
[00:56:45] I love to hear from them that the
[00:56:47] engineering schools are chock full of
[00:56:49] kids that want to start companies. I
[00:56:51] think that's going to be good for the
[00:56:52] world and good for [music] Europe. So,
[00:56:53] I'm excited about that. I hope you
[00:56:55] enjoyed the episode. I really liked it.
[00:56:57] These two are great. I will see you on
[00:56:59] the next episode of Long Strange Trip.
