[00:00:00] The models are moving so quickly. If you
[00:00:02] ask me this question in 3 months or 6
[00:00:03] months, my answer will be totally
[00:00:05] different. This is Boris Chney. He's the
[00:00:08] creator of Claude Code and former meta
[00:00:10] principal engineer. And we talked about
[00:00:12] everything that shaped his career. Can
[00:00:15] you explain latent demand?
[00:00:16] >> Latent demand I think is the single most
[00:00:18] important principle in product.
[00:00:20] >> You said that there were some clear
[00:00:22] cultural differences and that was
[00:00:24] difficult.
[00:00:25] >> Oh my god, difficult is such an
[00:00:26] understatement. It was a nightmare. We
[00:00:28] also talked about quad code and what's
[00:00:30] actually happening in enthropic right
[00:00:32] now. Even though enthropic has tripled,
[00:00:35] productivity per engineer has grown like
[00:00:36] almost 70% because of quad code. Don't
[00:00:39] build for the model of today. Build for
[00:00:41] the model 6 months from now. The one
[00:00:43] technical book I would recommend to
[00:00:45] everyone that has had the greatest
[00:00:47] impact on me as an engineer is what are
[00:00:49] your thoughts on the competition with
[00:00:51] codeex and openai?
[00:00:54] Here's the full episode.
[00:00:59] I want to start at the beginning of your
[00:01:01] story with you getting promoted to
[00:01:03] senior engineer at Meta. What's the
[00:01:06] story behind the projects that got you
[00:01:08] promoted and where were you at the time?
[00:01:11] If I remember right, the project was
[00:01:13] chats and groups and this was a project
[00:01:15] to bring uh Messenger and Facebook a
[00:01:17] little bit closer together. And I
[00:01:19] actually the first few projects that I
[00:01:21] worked on at Meta, it was about
[00:01:23] Messenger and Facebook. And I think the
[00:01:26] first one was like Zach had this idea
[00:01:28] about like syncing Messenger chats and
[00:01:30] Facebook groups. Um, but there's a few
[00:01:32] of these projects just trying to bring
[00:01:33] like uh Messenger and Facebook closer
[00:01:35] together. And I think the motivation was
[00:01:38] there was this feeling that this kind of
[00:01:40] public space social product was
[00:01:42] disappearing and that things were moving
[00:01:44] a little bit more into chat and these
[00:01:46] kind of more casual realtime spaces. And
[00:01:48] so we tried a few versions of the
[00:01:50] product and chats and groups is the one
[00:01:52] that worked. I think it was like number
[00:01:53] three or number four at the time and I I
[00:01:55] was in the Facebook groups or in um
[00:01:58] Facebook at the time and I was working a
[00:02:00] lot with messenger that was like
[00:02:01] organizationally very distant. And this
[00:02:03] is a idea that I think Steve who was a
[00:02:06] PM at the time he sort of had this idea
[00:02:08] this is a thing we should build and I
[00:02:09] just picked up on that and I was like
[00:02:10] yeah hell yeah let's let's do this. Uh
[00:02:13] and so I started hacking on it. Uh and
[00:02:15] then pretty soon there were some signs
[00:02:17] of life. So I asked for more engineers
[00:02:19] and uh there were three engineers that
[00:02:22] joined. There was uh Shatambri, uh
[00:02:24] Crystal and Chaang. They were like the
[00:02:27] first three engineers that joined this
[00:02:28] and then we got some uh we got some data
[00:02:30] science support, some design support. Um
[00:02:33] and it started just on web. Then we also
[00:02:36] moved to mobile a little bit and uh
[00:02:39] yeah, I think we just kind of proved out
[00:02:41] this idea that you can have chats inside
[00:02:43] of Facebook groups and this kind of
[00:02:44] product can work. And there's just like
[00:02:46] a lot of stuff honestly that didn't work
[00:02:47] at all about it. Um it was like a super
[00:02:50] jank experience I think by modern
[00:02:52] product standards. Like back in the day
[00:02:53] everyone was building on web and all
[00:02:55] sorts of bugs were totally okay.
[00:02:57] Nowadays, I think the standard honestly
[00:02:59] like the visual standard like quality
[00:03:00] standard is a lot higher and yeah so
[00:03:03] like the the product grew and we were
[00:03:04] such a small team like everyone had to
[00:03:07] do everything and I remember like we
[00:03:10] didn't have a user researcher so I would
[00:03:12] go to the cafeteria during lunch and we
[00:03:15] would have a new feature and we would
[00:03:16] show the cafeteria workers the feature
[00:03:18] and be like hey can you figure out how
[00:03:19] to open a chat and you know like
[00:03:21] sometimes they would find it sometimes
[00:03:22] they wouldn't be able to and this is
[00:03:24] just like an observational user research
[00:03:25] study So you kind of see how people like
[00:03:28] in a particular situation can do a task
[00:03:30] and you don't prompt them that much. So
[00:03:32] you you don't want to give too much away
[00:03:33] and you kind of see where they struggle.
[00:03:35] You see what they get. Um and so we we
[00:03:37] did this and then like I I kind of
[00:03:38] taught the team how to do this. So then
[00:03:40] pretty soon we would all go to the
[00:03:41] cafeteria at lunch and start like
[00:03:42] bugging cafeteria workers to you know as
[00:03:45] just kind of like representative users
[00:03:46] to be like you know does this make sense
[00:03:48] or not? It's interesting how the early
[00:03:51] Facebook culture that you were operating
[00:03:53] in let engineers do so much outside of
[00:03:57] just like the code. For instance, you're
[00:03:58] doing UXR. It sounds like in some of it
[00:04:02] I remember in your story you did some
[00:04:04] design as well and you were coaching
[00:04:05] people to do design. So I think that's
[00:04:07] pretty interesting unique thing in
[00:04:10] Facebook's culture. I think this is so
[00:04:13] important and I think to this day, you
[00:04:15] know, on the quad code team and this is
[00:04:17] the team that I'm on right now. We
[00:04:19] really prioritize generalists. So I love
[00:04:21] working with generalists. If you're an
[00:04:23] engineer that codes, but you can also do
[00:04:25] product work. You can also do design.
[00:04:27] You have product sense. You go, you want
[00:04:28] to go talk to your users. Like I love
[00:04:31] this kind of engineer to work with. And
[00:04:33] this is actually how we recruit for all
[00:04:35] functions now. So like our product
[00:04:36] managers code, our data scientists code,
[00:04:39] um our you know user researcher codes a
[00:04:41] little bit. So like I just love these
[00:04:43] generalists and I think this is really
[00:04:44] like the way that I grew up like from
[00:04:46] the beginning when I was running you
[00:04:47] know my first startup when I was like 18
[00:04:49] I had to do everything and uh up until
[00:04:53] Facebook I worked at smaller companies
[00:04:54] where you had to do everything and I
[00:04:56] kind of feel like at big companies you
[00:04:58] get forced into this you know particular
[00:05:00] swim lane but it's just sort of official
[00:05:02] cuz like what is engineering? It's like
[00:05:03] it's a very narrow skill set, but really
[00:05:05] the thing that you're doing is you're
[00:05:07] building product or you're building
[00:05:08] infra and there's just so much more that
[00:05:09] goes into doing that end to end besides
[00:05:11] just writing code. It it was just really
[00:05:14] cool being at a place that um I think
[00:05:16] Facebook uniquely kind of rewarded that
[00:05:18] at that time. And I I think actually at
[00:05:20] the end of that half I got promoted and
[00:05:22] then I think the half after every single
[00:05:24] one of the engineers got promoted too.
[00:05:25] In those early products, there was this
[00:05:28] concept
[00:05:29] um latent demand that you mentioned a
[00:05:32] few times, which uh it sounds like was
[00:05:35] the impetus for a lot of those product
[00:05:37] directions. Can you explain latent
[00:05:39] demand?
[00:05:40] >> Latent demand I think is the single most
[00:05:42] important principle in product and I
[00:05:45] think if you look at especially at
[00:05:47] Facebook successful products, every
[00:05:49] single one has an element of latent
[00:05:51] demand. So for example, a marketplace,
[00:05:54] it came from this observation that if
[00:05:55] you looked at Facebook groups at the
[00:05:56] time, 40% of the posts were buying and
[00:05:59] selling stuff. And so Facebook groups
[00:06:02] were not designed for commerce, but
[00:06:04] that's what people were using it for.
[00:06:06] And so it's kind of cool like you design
[00:06:08] this product in a way that can be
[00:06:09] hacked. It can be abused by users a
[00:06:11] little bit, and then you look at the
[00:06:12] data, you see how they're abusing it,
[00:06:14] and then you build a product around it.
[00:06:16] And so you know like there was Facebook
[00:06:18] groups and then there were buy sell
[00:06:19] groups and then that succeeded obviously
[00:06:21] because people already wanted to buy and
[00:06:22] sell and do commerce on Facebook groups
[00:06:24] and then marketplace was next. It was
[00:06:26] just a natural extension of the same
[00:06:27] intent that people had. Um I think
[00:06:30] Facebook dating was pretty similar. I
[00:06:32] think the observation was something like
[00:06:34] 60% of profile views were people of the
[00:06:36] opposite gender that were not friends
[00:06:37] with each other. Um, so you know this
[00:06:39] kind of like traditional like kind of
[00:06:41] like creeping on each other like and and
[00:06:44] I think for like um like Nate and like
[00:06:45] FMS at the time like this this was
[00:06:47] evidence that this would work. And I I
[00:06:49] think the the principle in product is
[00:06:51] you can never get people to do something
[00:06:53] they do not yet do. The thing you can do
[00:06:55] is you can find the intent that they
[00:06:57] have and then you can steer it to let
[00:07:00] them better kind of capitalize on that
[00:07:02] intent um and kind of do the thing the
[00:07:04] thing that they want more easily. I
[00:07:06] think also at this part of your story,
[00:07:08] you mentioned that you worked across
[00:07:10] orgs. You worked because you were
[00:07:12] bridging the gaps between messenger and
[00:07:14] a lot of the group's um engineering
[00:07:17] work. I'm curious, you said that there
[00:07:19] were some clear cultural differences and
[00:07:22] that was difficult. Uh do you have any
[00:07:24] advice for working across uh very
[00:07:27] different culture orgs?
[00:07:29] >> Oh my god, difficult is such an
[00:07:30] understatement. It was a nightmare. Like
[00:07:32] for Facebook at the time, we wanted to
[00:07:34] ship like we just wanted to go fast and
[00:07:36] ship awesome product as fast as we
[00:07:39] could. And then Messenger was all about
[00:07:41] reliability and performance. That's all
[00:07:43] they cared about. It was just polar
[00:07:44] opposite values. Um and this isn't just
[00:07:47] cultural. It's not just like an engineer
[00:07:49] to engineer thing. It's like the
[00:07:50] engineers on that team were suspicious
[00:07:52] of us because we would affect their
[00:07:53] performance metrics. And
[00:07:55] organizationally, their or was set up in
[00:07:57] a way to ship slowly without regressing
[00:07:59] the metrics and we were set up to ship
[00:08:01] quickly. So it's like and then the goals
[00:08:03] were totally different you know like
[00:08:05] they had SOA up times and for us it was
[00:08:06] just about daily active users and
[00:08:08] engagement. So I think for me the
[00:08:11] running was these kind of cultural
[00:08:12] values go super deep. It's not just a
[00:08:15] thing people talk about but you can
[00:08:17] actually see this in like in org design
[00:08:18] and in in goal design and in every part
[00:08:21] of everything. And honestly, I think one
[00:08:24] of the reasons that project uh failed
[00:08:28] was uh and eventually it evolved
[00:08:30] actually into something successful, but
[00:08:32] that version of the project failed was
[00:08:34] because of this difference in values.
[00:08:36] So
[00:08:38] I think that fundamentally if you want
[00:08:40] to get companies with really different
[00:08:42] values to succeed and kind of work
[00:08:44] together, you have to find some kind of
[00:08:46] shared goal or kind of shared interest,
[00:08:48] shared belief, some kind of hypothesis
[00:08:50] that they want to test together that
[00:08:51] would be really interesting for both of
[00:08:53] them if it worked. Um, and I think this
[00:08:56] like chats and groups thing
[00:08:57] fundamentally was really cool for
[00:08:58] Facebook, but it's not that cool for
[00:09:00] Messenger for a lot of reasons. So,
[00:09:02] knowing what you know now, how would you
[00:09:06] change things going back to that kind of
[00:09:08] project?
[00:09:08] >> I think I probably would have gone to
[00:09:10] Zuck and just been like, if you're
[00:09:11] really serious about this thing, we we
[00:09:13] should move Messenger into the Facebook
[00:09:15] or and I think this has since happened
[00:09:17] and it's actually happened like a few
[00:09:18] times like Messenger was in the or then
[00:09:20] it moved out and then it moved in then
[00:09:22] moved out. It's a big company like this
[00:09:24] happens. But I think fundamentally for
[00:09:26] this kind of thing to succeed, the the
[00:09:27] common report can't be, you know, the
[00:09:30] common manager can't be like Chris Cox.
[00:09:32] It has to be like a little bit lower
[00:09:33] down. And so you can structure the orgs
[00:09:35] to be a little bit more collaborative.
[00:09:37] >> I see. To align the incentives so you
[00:09:39] don't get that kind of constant
[00:09:41] struggle.
[00:09:42] >> Yeah. Exactly. at this point in your
[00:09:44] career, I saw there were a bunch of
[00:09:46] really interesting side projects that
[00:09:48] you had and I'm kind of curious like
[00:09:50] what what's the butterfly effect of
[00:09:51] those kinds of projects? So, for
[00:09:53] instance, um even before you got to
[00:09:55] meta, you worked on Undux, the state
[00:09:58] management framework for React. Um I'm
[00:10:01] curious like how did that impact your
[00:10:04] career if at all?
[00:10:06] >> Yeah, I mean for me side quests are so
[00:10:07] important and for me like when I hire
[00:10:09] engineers this is definitely something I
[00:10:11] look for. I want people with side
[00:10:13] quests, like cool weekend projects, cool
[00:10:16] side projects, like even someone that's
[00:10:18] like, you know, just really into like
[00:10:19] making kombucha or something. Like you
[00:10:21] want people that are generally curious
[00:10:22] and interested in stuff outside of their
[00:10:24] main work. These are kind of
[00:10:25] well-rounded people. These are the kinds
[00:10:27] of people I enjoy working with. I think
[00:10:29] for me, this is where a lot of my growth
[00:10:31] came from is um working on these kind of
[00:10:35] side projects. So something like Unex
[00:10:37] honestly where it came from is uh React
[00:10:40] state management is honestly
[00:10:41] unnecessarily complicated and at the
[00:10:44] time the state-of-the-art was there
[00:10:46] there was like flux and then there was
[00:10:48] this other thing called Redux and I just
[00:10:50] couldn't wrap my head around Redux. I
[00:10:52] was just you know I I consider myself
[00:10:53] kind of average engineer like I build
[00:10:55] product. I'm like I'm not one of these
[00:10:57] like incredible systems engineers. And
[00:10:59] so for me like Redux at the time I had
[00:11:01] these concepts of like you know like
[00:11:02] reducers and this kind of like just like
[00:11:05] this like very complicated flow you had
[00:11:07] to go to to just like update a little
[00:11:08] state and I just couldn't wrap my head
[00:11:10] around it. So I I built a simpler thing
[00:11:12] that seemed to work. I used that um I
[00:11:15] was volunteering at a nonprofit at the
[00:11:16] time and uh they started using it and
[00:11:18] their engineers liked it. And then when
[00:11:20] I joined Facebook, I saw a lot of kind
[00:11:23] of frustration around Redux usage
[00:11:26] because there was a internal group for
[00:11:28] people that use Redux and there were all
[00:11:29] these questions where people were asking
[00:11:30] the same questions I did. Um, you know,
[00:11:33] like when you as an engineer or, you
[00:11:35] know, as a product person are running
[00:11:36] into a problem, sometimes it's just you.
[00:11:39] Often it's other people too. And I think
[00:11:42] it's important to build the spidey sense
[00:11:43] for like when this problem might be
[00:11:44] shared by others. And so this is a
[00:11:46] problem that definitely was shared by
[00:11:48] others. And I could kind of see this in
[00:11:50] support posts and by the difficulty my
[00:11:52] team had using Redux.
[00:11:54] And so I launched uh Unux internally and
[00:11:57] Unex is like it's fine. It's like not
[00:11:58] that great of a product, but at least
[00:12:00] it's better than Redux. And um at
[00:12:03] Facebook I didn't actually know how to
[00:12:04] get adoption. So I kind of posted about
[00:12:05] it. A few people started to use it. Um I
[00:12:08] remember there was like Jeff Case on the
[00:12:09] notifications team was a big early
[00:12:10] adopter and we spent some late nights
[00:12:12] debugging some like gnarly like
[00:12:14] notification related bugs due to it. And
[00:12:18] um I wanted to get more adoption. And so
[00:12:20] what I did was I wrote a little script
[00:12:22] and I scraped the group of uh people
[00:12:24] reporting issues and I just tallied them
[00:12:27] by team. And then I reached out just
[00:12:30] over chat to the tech lead and the
[00:12:31] manager for every team and I scheduled
[00:12:33] uh like a tech talk just for that team.
[00:12:36] And I think overall I did maybe 20 30 40
[00:12:39] tech talks something like that over the
[00:12:41] course of like a few weeks. Yeah.
[00:12:43] >> And I I remember just like biking around
[00:12:45] the meta campus and kind of doing these
[00:12:47] talks and it was so fun cuz people were
[00:12:49] so engaged and they were just so excited
[00:12:50] that someone cares about solving this
[00:12:52] problem that they they really have and I
[00:12:55] think at some point on was like the most
[00:12:57] popular state management framework at
[00:12:59] Facebook and then I think it got pretty
[00:13:01] quickly replaced by recoil and kind of
[00:13:02] more modern alternatives and nowadays
[00:13:05] it's like relay and and things like
[00:13:06] that. Does that kind of side project
[00:13:08] appear in your like performance review
[00:13:11] or is it like help you in some way? So I
[00:13:13] think it was in my performance review. I
[00:13:15] think by meta standards it's kind of a
[00:13:17] cherry on top. It wasn't really you know
[00:13:19] something that kind of gets you to the
[00:13:20] next level in itself. Um but I had a lot
[00:13:22] of other side quests around uh around
[00:13:24] that time too. Like at some point I got
[00:13:26] really into TypeScript actually and this
[00:13:28] was like at the previous company I was
[00:13:29] at. We were using it. There weren't a
[00:13:31] lot of good resources. And so I just
[00:13:34] like started writing a book about it cuz
[00:13:36] I was like someone like someone should
[00:13:37] do this. It's crazy it doesn't exist.
[00:13:39] This language is just like magnificent.
[00:13:41] It's it's just this like really really
[00:13:43] shockingly
[00:13:45] shockingly good design. It has all these
[00:13:47] ideas that no other language had at the
[00:13:50] time. Um you know things like eventually
[00:13:53] like at the time there were no
[00:13:54] conditional types but like conditional
[00:13:56] types like literal types for everything.
[00:13:58] Uh map types these are just like
[00:14:00] absolutely insane things. like even the
[00:14:02] like the gnarliest Haskeller is going to
[00:14:04] be impressed by this kind of language
[00:14:05] feature, but no one was writing about
[00:14:07] this stuff and so I just got like super
[00:14:09] into it and like wrote this book and it
[00:14:11] it just sort of like ate up like a year
[00:14:13] of my life. Would not recommend it. Um
[00:14:16] but it was really fun to go really deep
[00:14:17] on it and then I also started I think
[00:14:19] like the world's biggest TypeScript
[00:14:21] meetup at the time in in San Francisco
[00:14:23] and that was a really cool chance to
[00:14:24] meet uh there was like Ryan Doll who
[00:14:26] created Node.js. there was um just like
[00:14:28] all all these like famous JavaScript
[00:14:30] celebrities and it just sort of made me
[00:14:32] realize like all these people are just
[00:14:34] people and um you know like everyone
[00:14:38] just like builds cool stuff and some of
[00:14:40] it's cool some of it's cool at a
[00:14:41] particular time but it's all just people
[00:14:43] and anyone can do this stuff.
[00:14:45] >> Did you end up using TypeScript or that
[00:14:47] technical depth later in your time at
[00:14:49] Meta or or maybe even in anthropic?
[00:14:52] Yeah, I think there was, you know, it's
[00:14:54] funny. I actually like I used to not
[00:14:56] care about languages and then at some
[00:14:58] point, this was maybe like 10 years ago,
[00:14:59] I used to ride a motorcycle and I got in
[00:15:01] a pretty bad accident actually. I broke
[00:15:03] my arms.
[00:15:03] >> Oh my god.
[00:15:05] >> Both of them.
[00:15:05] >> Both of them. Yeah. I had like two
[00:15:06] slings on.
[00:15:07] >> Oh my god. How'd you code?
[00:15:08] >> Um, so that was the hard part. So like I
[00:15:10] actually like couldn't code for like a
[00:15:11] month and then you know my hands like
[00:15:12] still kind of hurt and so like I
[00:15:14] couldn't write JavaScript which is what
[00:15:16] I used to write at the time. And so I
[00:15:19] actually had to branch out and learn
[00:15:20] other languages because they literally
[00:15:22] used less keystrokes.
[00:15:24] And so I started with like coffees
[00:15:25] script because there was like less
[00:15:27] parenthesis and stuff. I don't I don't
[00:15:28] think that language even exists. No one
[00:15:29] uses it nowadays. Um but that's also how
[00:15:32] I got into Haskell and kind of
[00:15:33] functional programming. Um cuz it was
[00:15:35] kind of you can do the same thing with
[00:15:36] fewer keystrokes and that that was like
[00:15:38] literally the motivation at the time.
[00:15:40] And then at some point I was working in
[00:15:43] uh at a hedge fund and this was like
[00:15:45] before uh before Facebook and I had a
[00:15:48] co-orker Rick who was really into Scola
[00:15:50] and I really didn't understand Scola and
[00:15:53] uh he he kind of really got me into it
[00:15:55] and he got me into this like functional
[00:15:56] programming side of the house and this
[00:15:58] is still like the one technical book I
[00:16:00] would recommend to everyone that has had
[00:16:02] the greatest impact on me as an engineer
[00:16:05] is this book called functional
[00:16:06] programming in Scola and you're probably
[00:16:09] never going to use schol today, but the
[00:16:12] way it teaches you to think about coding
[00:16:14] problems is just such a change from the
[00:16:16] way that most people were encoding
[00:16:18] either practically or in school is just
[00:16:21] it's incredible. it's going to
[00:16:22] completely change the way that you code.
[00:16:24] And so for me it was it was kind of like
[00:16:26] Scola was like there was kind of like
[00:16:28] Haskell and kind of coffecript these
[00:16:30] kind of few key languages that was like
[00:16:32] a first step then Scola and then
[00:16:35] Typescript and I think this kind of this
[00:16:37] changed the way I think because now I
[00:16:39] think in types when I code the thing
[00:16:41] that matters in your code the most is
[00:16:42] the type signatures. This is more
[00:16:43] important than the code itself. And so
[00:16:45] like getting this right leads to very
[00:16:47] clean code. And so even at Facebook
[00:16:50] where I was writing mostly kind of flow
[00:16:51] and and hack and then later at Instagram
[00:16:53] Python um it it was very helpful here at
[00:16:57] anthropic I mostly write typescript and
[00:16:58] python um so it's actually quite
[00:17:00] relevant but I but I think the the
[00:17:02] bigger lesson is just think in think in
[00:17:04] types
[00:17:05] >> at this point in your career uh you
[00:17:07] mentioned that you came in underleveled
[00:17:09] you came in as a mid-level engineer even
[00:17:12] though you had a lot of experience and
[00:17:13] you said um in hindsight you were lucky
[00:17:16] to be underleveled and I'm curious is
[00:17:18] what's the the thinking behind that?
[00:17:21] >> Just lower expectations.
[00:17:23] Um yeah, I feel I feel like at a big
[00:17:26] company there's all these kind of um
[00:17:30] you know like at every level there's
[00:17:32] certain expectations in terms of kind of
[00:17:34] the project impact and people impact and
[00:17:37] all this kind of stuff and the the
[00:17:39] specific criteria are kind of different
[00:17:40] across companies. Um but there's um I
[00:17:44] think a lot of it is about either
[00:17:46] project impact or kind of checking a
[00:17:48] bunch of check boxes and all this just
[00:17:50] takes a lot of time. Um and so I think
[00:17:52] coming in under level it just gave me
[00:17:54] the space to explore and uh just like
[00:17:57] build cool stuff for the sake of
[00:17:59] building cool stuff. Definitely. And I
[00:18:01] wonder if it also helps with building
[00:18:05] momentum. Like what I mean is if you
[00:18:07] came in as a mid-level or E4 and then
[00:18:11] you you crushing it. Everyone's saying
[00:18:14] Boris is amazing. What this is crazy as
[00:18:17] opposed to you came in at your whatever
[00:18:20] I don't know expectations and you did
[00:18:23] good. I think there can be this uh
[00:18:26] effect when you come in and you really
[00:18:28] wow everyone. you have such a strong um
[00:18:31] you know first impression I think can be
[00:18:34] helpful for building a good reputation
[00:18:36] that gives you more credibility more
[00:18:38] projects and stuff like that in the
[00:18:40] future.
[00:18:40] >> Yeah, I think that's totally true and I
[00:18:42] I think actually this is probably good
[00:18:43] advice for any company is like I think a
[00:18:46] lot of times engineers switch jobs and
[00:18:47] they really push you know like I want to
[00:18:49] go to a different company and I want
[00:18:50] like a level plus one or whatever and
[00:18:52] actually there's a lot of downsides to
[00:18:54] that like you said. Going on to the
[00:18:56] thing that got you promoted to staff or
[00:18:58] E6 at Meta, I'm curious the story behind
[00:19:02] um you know where you were at the time
[00:19:04] and what got you promoted into more of
[00:19:06] that leadership position. So what was
[00:19:08] happening was chats and groups that was
[00:19:10] launched and that that was going and
[00:19:11] there was kind of a team working on
[00:19:13] this. Um, and uh, I actually had a I I'd
[00:19:19] done a lot of JavaScript before I
[00:19:20] joined, but at Facebook, I'd never
[00:19:23] actually written JavaScript cuz it was
[00:19:25] all PHP.
[00:19:27] >> And so I really just wanted to write
[00:19:28] JavaScript. And we had this like web
[00:19:30] interface. And for Facebook groups in
[00:19:32] particular, a lot of people use web as
[00:19:34] opposed to mobile because, for example,
[00:19:36] for like being a group admin or
[00:19:38] whatever, it's just easier to do on a
[00:19:40] big computer with a with a keyboard and
[00:19:41] stuff. And at the time the site was
[00:19:44] really janky. It was like a static site.
[00:19:46] It was all PHP. There's these little
[00:19:47] bits of JavaScript that are injected a
[00:19:50] little bit in different places. There's
[00:19:52] all sorts of inconsistent state like all
[00:19:54] these problems that come out of it. It's
[00:19:55] just it doesn't feel like a good UX. And
[00:19:58] so I wanted to rewrite it in JavaScript
[00:20:00] and I got a lot of push back from the or
[00:20:01] at the time. And I think the big reason
[00:20:04] was that the info just wasn't really
[00:20:05] ready for it.
[00:20:08] Luckily, at the same time, Comet was
[00:20:09] starting and Comet was like the rewrite
[00:20:11] of facebook.com on desktop. And this is
[00:20:14] like Tomcino, who's who's now at Versel,
[00:20:16] this was Jing Chen. Um, there there's a
[00:20:19] bunch of these kind of core people that
[00:20:20] that were working on this. And I just
[00:20:23] really wanted to be involved. So, I
[00:20:24] reached out and asked how I can help.
[00:20:27] And I offered Facebook groups as the
[00:20:28] guinea pig for it. And I didn't ask
[00:20:30] anyone. Just kind of just kind of did
[00:20:32] it. And then uh later I kind of went to
[00:20:34] my leadership in Facebook groups and I
[00:20:36] was like, "Hey, comments's coming. It's
[00:20:37] going to be a bunch of work. We can get
[00:20:39] ahead of it." Kind of set the standard
[00:20:40] for everyone, build relationships with
[00:20:42] these other teams. And I still got a
[00:20:44] bunch of push back that was like, "Hey,
[00:20:45] you know, you can't put 20 engineers on
[00:20:47] this." And uh after a bunch of reviews
[00:20:50] and kind of haggling for engineers, I
[00:20:52] think we put we got like 12 engineers or
[00:20:54] something like that cuz it was a pretty
[00:20:55] big migration. You know, it's going to
[00:20:57] take like a year. groups is the single
[00:20:59] biggest product surface in all Facebook,
[00:21:01] which is actually kind of surprising.
[00:21:04] Um, yeah, and the the migration kind of
[00:21:06] worked and and I think something that
[00:21:07] was pretty fun about it besides just
[00:21:09] like building relationships and
[00:21:10] friendships with this infra team I never
[00:21:12] would have worked with otherwise, which
[00:21:14] was in itself so rewarding and so fun.
[00:21:16] Um, I think a lot of it was we got to
[00:21:19] influence the direction of Comet. And
[00:21:21] it's kind of weird because for an info
[00:21:22] project, a product team often cannot
[00:21:25] influence the direction. and they're
[00:21:26] more seen as a customer of it. But what
[00:21:28] happened here was because we helped
[00:21:30] co-build it, we built a lot of the
[00:21:32] abstractions that were then used by
[00:21:35] other teams that were also building on
[00:21:37] Comet. Um, and you know, for example, a
[00:21:39] particular one I remember was like relay
[00:21:41] mutations. So like you send API requests
[00:21:43] and you need some sort of consistency.
[00:21:45] Um, but there's actually this bug where
[00:21:47] like let's say there's like a button and
[00:21:49] you press the button. Every time you
[00:21:50] press it, you send a post request. And
[00:21:52] uh every time you press the button, it
[00:21:54] toggles the state of that button. For
[00:21:56] really nice UX, what you want is as soon
[00:21:58] as you press the button, the state
[00:21:59] should toggle, which means you need an
[00:22:01] optimistic update. But also, uh when the
[00:22:04] network request comes back, you need to
[00:22:05] also update the local cache to make sure
[00:22:07] it's consistent. And if you're just like
[00:22:09] mashing that button, what can happen is
[00:22:10] that the responses come in out of order
[00:22:13] and you might end up with a different
[00:22:14] state than what was in the UI. Um and so
[00:22:17] I wrote a system to kind of queue up
[00:22:18] mutations. So it was like consistency at
[00:22:20] the cost of reliability and this was
[00:22:21] kind of the right trade-off at the time.
[00:22:23] Uh and everyone ended up using this and
[00:22:25] this is how I met like Joseona and a
[00:22:27] bunch of the relay team that was working
[00:22:29] on the the data stores. Um, and it was
[00:22:31] just really fun. And this is something
[00:22:33] that since then and before then and you
[00:22:36] know whenever I work with engineers, I
[00:22:39] just love when people go a layer deeper
[00:22:41] and uh, you know, just try to figure out
[00:22:43] like what's going on and like just
[00:22:44] because you're a product engineer
[00:22:46] doesn't mean you can't build infra. Just
[00:22:47] because you're an infra engineer doesn't
[00:22:49] mean you can't go talk to users like
[00:22:50] just be curious about these other parts
[00:22:52] of the stack.
[00:22:53] >> Definitely. and in your agency and
[00:22:56] getting ahead of comet or this big
[00:22:58] JavaScript rewrite. You mentioned in
[00:23:00] your in your writing that you know
[00:23:02] getting ahead of that actually gave you
[00:23:04] a lot more control and also dibs on
[00:23:06] opportunities. So when you talk about
[00:23:08] opportunities there is is this what
[00:23:10] you're kind of talking about like
[00:23:12] building these fundamental pieces of
[00:23:13] prod infra that are impactful for
[00:23:16] everyone that's going to take on the new
[00:23:18] platform?
[00:23:19] >> Yeah. Yeah, that's an example of it. Um,
[00:23:21] and then maybe you know like a different
[00:23:23] kind of example is Comet was a lot
[00:23:26] higher quality than the thing that came
[00:23:27] before because it, you know, it's like a
[00:23:28] single page web app. Um, so it can just
[00:23:30] feel a lot more polished. But we hadn't
[00:23:32] yet figured out like what exactly
[00:23:34] quality means on the product side. And
[00:23:36] so I wrote a bunch of notes trying to
[00:23:37] define that and then did a bunch of tech
[00:23:39] talks trying to just like teach people
[00:23:40] on other teams like here's what we
[00:23:42] learned about quality. Um, and just kind
[00:23:45] of like setting up the conversation
[00:23:46] about that.
[00:23:48] you mentioned a big headcount ask for I
[00:23:51] guess this migration to comment you know
[00:23:54] I feel like I'd be curious what that
[00:23:57] would look like in today with these new
[00:24:00] tools like cloud codeex etc. I'd be
[00:24:04] curious like knowing what you know now
[00:24:06] about cloud code and you let's say you
[00:24:08] were in charge of doing that same
[00:24:10] scoping for that same job. How many
[00:24:12] engineers do you think it'd take to do
[00:24:14] that 12 engineer job?
[00:24:16] >> Yeah. So I think overall to move
[00:24:18] Facebook groups it it started with 12
[00:24:20] engineers but I think at the end it was
[00:24:22] maybe like 20 or 30 engineers or
[00:24:23] something for about two years. So it
[00:24:25] turned out to be a pretty big project.
[00:24:27] Um I think nowadays it would be maybe
[00:24:30] I don't know like five engineers for six
[00:24:32] months something something like that.
[00:24:34] >> So a fourth of the fourth of the time
[00:24:37] and um like more than a third or less
[00:24:40] than a third of the engineers as well.
[00:24:42] >> Yeah. Yeah. cuz you just like everyone
[00:24:44] would just have a bunch of quads running
[00:24:45] in parallel and you know just like let
[00:24:47] it cook for a couple hours and then it
[00:24:48] comes back with a PR and then you give
[00:24:50] it like puppeteer or something so it can
[00:24:52] kind of see the UI and and adjust and I
[00:24:54] I think that's pretty much all it would
[00:24:55] be and then I you know nowadays the
[00:24:58] world we're in is so different from a
[00:24:59] coding point of view because the models
[00:25:03] are moving so quickly that you know if
[00:25:06] you ask me this question in 3 months or
[00:25:07] 6 months my answer will be totally
[00:25:09] different in 6 months the answer might
[00:25:11] be this is actually one engineer
[00:25:13] um it's just moving so quickly now it's
[00:25:15] really hard to to do these estimates or
[00:25:17] to predict how they're going to change
[00:25:18] in the future.
[00:25:20] >> At this point in your career you you had
[00:25:22] mentioned something maybe it was
[00:25:23] tongue-in-cheek I'm not sure. You said
[00:25:25] this was when I learned to always
[00:25:27] present three options in VP reviews
[00:25:29] since 80% of the time they'll just pick
[00:25:32] the middle option and then it says you
[00:25:34] your VP picked the middle option in
[00:25:36] frenies. Um what's the thinking behind
[00:25:38] that?
[00:25:40] Yeah, this is this is very much tongue
[00:25:42] andcheek. Um, but maybe this is actually
[00:25:44] kind of true at Meta at the time.
[00:25:47] Um, I think like decision makers that
[00:25:49] are far away from the work want to know
[00:25:52] that you did the due diligence of
[00:25:55] finding the right options and the right
[00:25:57] trade-offs and that you did the work,
[00:25:58] but they also want to contribute somehow
[00:26:00] to the decision. Um, so, you know, the
[00:26:03] middle option is kind of the easy way to
[00:26:04] do that. It's a little tongue-in-cheek
[00:26:06] because I think not all leaders are like
[00:26:08] this. A lot of leaders will do their
[00:26:10] work themselves. They trust their teams
[00:26:12] more or less. There's sort of there's so
[00:26:14] many different ways to operate. Um, but
[00:26:16] at the time I remember we had like a
[00:26:18] pretty non-technical leader and this was
[00:26:20] kind of the way to to help her make make
[00:26:22] decisions. I think at this point in your
[00:26:24] career you had the most proximity you've
[00:26:27] had to senior management. It's you said
[00:26:30] you were reporting to uh a senior
[00:26:32] director at some point and you were
[00:26:34] involved in a lot of huge scoping
[00:26:36] conversations. I'm curious what's the
[00:26:38] downstream effects of reporting to
[00:26:39] someone so senior like that.
[00:26:41] >> Yeah, I think it kind of depends on the
[00:26:43] engineer and it depends on the company.
[00:26:46] Um, so for example, like you know, now
[00:26:48] I'm at Anthropic and I think at
[00:26:50] anthropic it doesn't matter. Um, it
[00:26:52] doesn't it doesn't matter which level
[00:26:53] you report to. There's some of the most
[00:26:55] senior people at the company report to
[00:26:56] line managers. Um, a lot of the line
[00:26:59] managers are like XCTO's and things like
[00:27:01] this. So um, it actually doesn't matter.
[00:27:04] So I think this is kind of like a meta
[00:27:05] it's a very meta-pecific cultural um
[00:27:08] cultural observation. I think there's
[00:27:11] sort of like two things going on. So one
[00:27:13] is you want at meta you needed uh as an
[00:27:17] engineer you always needed to find
[00:27:19] scope. Some of this you can find
[00:27:21] yourself and then some of it your
[00:27:22] manager helps you find or you know your
[00:27:24] tech lead or the people you surround
[00:27:25] yourself with and you know like the PSC
[00:27:29] process is like growing like famously
[00:27:30] growing at meta and so you just have to
[00:27:33] constantly talk about your impact and
[00:27:34] like scope is like the biggest
[00:27:35] contributor to that like if you have
[00:27:37] enough scope and you executed well
[00:27:38] that's impact that's the formula I think
[00:27:41] the other part was at meta no one had
[00:27:45] titles so even the most senior engineers
[00:27:47] their title was software engineer which
[00:27:49] I actually really love. And um you know
[00:27:52] like Bell We L We L We L We L We L We L
[00:27:52] We L We L We L We Labs had this with
[00:27:53] like member of technical staff and this
[00:27:55] is true at anthropic too, but we
[00:27:56] actually go even further here.
[00:27:58] Everyone's title is member of technical
[00:28:00] staff. It doesn't even matter if you're
[00:28:02] an engineer or a PM or a designer, it's
[00:28:04] all the same title. Um, and I actually
[00:28:06] really love it because back to this
[00:28:09] point of working outside your lane and
[00:28:11] doing stuff that just should be done
[00:28:14] and, you know, like are just good things
[00:28:15] to do regardless of what you are
[00:28:17] personally expected to do. Um, I think
[00:28:20] this kind of culture just sets that up.
[00:28:22] I mean, I I I see a lot of the benefits
[00:28:24] of the no titles. I could also see a
[00:28:27] case though where um and maybe this is
[00:28:29] only true for big companies where you
[00:28:31] reach out to someone across the company
[00:28:33] and you say hey I'd like to I don't know
[00:28:36] do this collaboration and if your title
[00:28:38] said director or whatever it kind of is
[00:28:42] like a shortcut for them to understand
[00:28:44] how seriously to take you or how to
[00:28:47] interact with you like if you're a
[00:28:48] designer or some other role. So I mean
[00:28:52] now anthropics got a bit bigger at this
[00:28:54] point. Do you see uh any of that? I
[00:28:56] mean, people probably all know you, so
[00:28:58] maybe you don't see it as much.
[00:29:00] >> Yeah, I think I think this is definitely
[00:29:01] the downside. I think the upside
[00:29:03] outweighs it, which is you have to earn
[00:29:05] trust. And I I think this is true. Like,
[00:29:08] you know, regardless of what company
[00:29:10] you're at, you got to earn it. And just
[00:29:12] because you did a cool thing before,
[00:29:14] doesn't mean that you have you should
[00:29:16] deserve respect. Well, everyone deserves
[00:29:18] respect. Doesn't mean that you should
[00:29:19] deserve authority at a new company in a
[00:29:21] new setting. Um, so I think even for
[00:29:24] people coming in with manager titles,
[00:29:25] you kind of have to earn it. And in some
[00:29:26] ways, having a manager title makes it a
[00:29:28] little bit harder to earn this kind of
[00:29:30] trust. Um, so as an IC, you got to do it
[00:29:33] either way. And I I think just the lack
[00:29:34] of titles makes it a little easier. At
[00:29:37] this point in your career, you were kind
[00:29:38] of like becoming more and more of a tech
[00:29:41] lead or Uber tech lead. And I think you
[00:29:44] had a few stories where you scoped out
[00:29:46] work for hundreds of engineers. And I
[00:29:48] was just thinking about how do you do
[00:29:51] that if there's so much to scope and you
[00:29:54] know you're one person. How do you go
[00:29:56] about doing such massive scoping
[00:29:59] requests for leadership?
[00:30:01] >> Yeah, this was a totally insane time. So
[00:30:03] I worked a lot with uh Tina Shutchman
[00:30:04] who's uh she she's now at Microsoft um
[00:30:07] but she was she was my manager at the
[00:30:08] time and then uh Ephe who's who's my
[00:30:10] manager after and there was a lot more
[00:30:13] investment going into Facebook groups at
[00:30:16] the time. So I think the org was maybe
[00:30:19] 150 or 200 people when I joined and by
[00:30:21] the time I left to Instagram I think it
[00:30:23] was like 600 or 800 people something
[00:30:24] like that. So there's this feeling from
[00:30:27] Zach that Facebook app should be all
[00:30:30] about communities and he just wanted us
[00:30:32] to go like faster and faster to make
[00:30:34] that a reality and you know as an
[00:30:36] executive your kind of biggest way to do
[00:30:38] that is to put the right people in
[00:30:40] charge of decisions and then uh to give
[00:30:42] them resources and so like in you know
[00:30:44] in the case of meta it's it's just
[00:30:45] engineers um you don't need like GPUs
[00:30:47] for this you need like engineers to do
[00:30:49] stuff and so we pitched this project to
[00:30:52] uh to Zach and it was called communities
[00:30:54] as the new organizations that was like
[00:30:55] the internal name and uh he grin just
[00:30:58] like a a bunch of headcount to go
[00:31:00] towards this and so we just had to
[00:31:01] figure out what these people will do and
[00:31:04] you know for him I I get it it's like if
[00:31:06] the thing is important you got to put a
[00:31:07] bunch of people on it in hindsight what
[00:31:09] I would have done differently is I I
[00:31:11] would have put way less people on it
[00:31:13] because what matters is like solving
[00:31:15] people's problems and building awesome
[00:31:17] product and this actually has to kind of
[00:31:19] be bottoms up and you kind of want to
[00:31:21] like slowly dial this up as you find
[00:31:23] product market fit for new product lines
[00:31:24] you can't just do it all at once. And uh
[00:31:28] yeah, we just had to like scope out all
[00:31:30] the stuff. Like there were weeks where I
[00:31:31] had to, you know, do like a scoping dock
[00:31:33] for like, okay, we're going to put 30
[00:31:34] engineers on this. Here's like three
[00:31:35] technical options. We're going to pick
[00:31:36] this one. Next project, we're going to
[00:31:38] put 20 engineers on this. Here's three
[00:31:39] options. We're going to pick this one.
[00:31:41] Next project we're going to do. And just
[00:31:42] like doing this like over and over again
[00:31:44] just to have like, you know, some some
[00:31:46] sort of confidence that this thing isn't
[00:31:47] totally crazy. We did some baseline
[00:31:49] technical scoping roughly matching the
[00:31:51] number of engineers to the project. And
[00:31:54] there there's actually some pretty fun
[00:31:55] stuff like I remember we were trying to
[00:31:57] merge Facebook groups and uh pages at
[00:31:59] some point like in the in the data model
[00:32:01] side and this was this like very gnarly
[00:32:03] migration it would have been you know to
[00:32:06] fully do it this is like many years and
[00:32:07] like probably hundreds of engineers to
[00:32:09] fully do it because you have to do it
[00:32:10] across like the data model the product
[00:32:12] layer integrity systems ad systems
[00:32:14] there's just all sorts of stuff that has
[00:32:16] to get merged and at the time Ysef
[00:32:18] Carver uh he just joined I think he came
[00:32:21] from either profile or events like a
[00:32:23] different or that that joined forces
[00:32:25] with groups to make this happen and he
[00:32:28] was working on it but he was kind of
[00:32:29] struggling with a with a decision at the
[00:32:30] time and I think he was even more senior
[00:32:32] than I was but he just like wasn't
[00:32:33] making the decision on the data model
[00:32:35] and so I just took a bunch of people and
[00:32:37] I was like all right the tech leads
[00:32:39] across the entire org we're going to
[00:32:41] spend the next like 3 hours on this day
[00:32:44] and we're going to do this like
[00:32:45] essentially like game where we get to do
[00:32:47] architecture and so I split everyone up
[00:32:50] into two teams I think it was like blue
[00:32:51] team and green team or I I forget what
[00:32:53] these were. And we gave everyone this
[00:32:55] like this problem of like how do you
[00:32:56] merge these data models? Here are the
[00:32:58] requirements. And then everyone had 3
[00:33:00] hours in a whiteboard and they had to
[00:33:01] come up with a design. And what was cool
[00:33:03] is that going into it, we had no idea
[00:33:06] how we would do this because it just
[00:33:07] seemed too crazy of a problem. But the
[00:33:10] going out of it, we had two designs that
[00:33:12] were 80% the same. And so it was really
[00:33:15] obvious what we could execute on. And
[00:33:16] then the 20% where the differences were,
[00:33:18] it was very obvious where the risk was.
[00:33:20] And so we could kind of front front
[00:33:22] frontload a little bit of that risk with
[00:33:23] a little bit of technical spikes. Um but
[00:33:25] also we can just start execution right
[00:33:27] away because we knew exactly what we had
[00:33:28] to do.
[00:33:29] >> Yeah, that was really interesting when I
[00:33:31] saw that it was like a technical design
[00:33:34] competition with all the senior
[00:33:36] engineers and you just put people in
[00:33:38] separate rooms to come up with um I've
[00:33:42] never heard anything like that. When you
[00:33:43] proposed that idea for this design
[00:33:45] competition within the org, were people
[00:33:48] excited about it or was it like kind of
[00:33:50] a crazy idea?
[00:33:51] >> Yeah, it was sort of crazy. I mean, with
[00:33:52] this sort of thing, you just have to
[00:33:53] kind of do it. So, I just I just kind of
[00:33:55] told everyone, "Hey, we're doing this."
[00:33:56] And then I just put it on everyone's
[00:33:58] calendar and um it just seems fun, you
[00:34:01] know? So, like as an engineer, you would
[00:34:02] want to do it. But I think this is the
[00:34:04] sort of thing where like sometimes you
[00:34:05] need consensus and sometimes you just
[00:34:07] have to act. And in this case, because
[00:34:09] the path was unclear, it was important
[00:34:10] to act. But at the same time, I didn't
[00:34:13] know how to proceed. So, we had to kind
[00:34:15] of get everyone together to build
[00:34:16] consensus. And so, I think it's like as
[00:34:18] a leader, you're kind of always juggling
[00:34:19] these kind of two things.
[00:34:20] >> After that experience, just giving being
[00:34:23] given hundreds of engineers and scoping
[00:34:25] things out, do you have any tips for
[00:34:28] someone who's like a tech lead who's
[00:34:30] needs to do quick, you know, scoping?
[00:34:32] Anything that worked well for you? I
[00:34:34] think the biggest thing I think the
[00:34:36] biggest foe that I've seen is people
[00:34:37] just taking too long and getting too
[00:34:38] into the weeds. there's always an
[00:34:40] infinite number of details. Just start
[00:34:42] with a high level. You know, most
[00:34:44] technical scoping you can do within like
[00:34:45] 30 minutes very very roughly. Um and if
[00:34:49] you don't know the systems like nowadays
[00:34:50] you would just use quad code run in the
[00:34:52] codebase and just ask it to like you
[00:34:54] know like what are all the systems
[00:34:55] involved? They can actually just do this
[00:34:56] for you. And this is another just
[00:34:58] totally insane change. You know I when I
[00:35:01] was doing this stuff I never would have
[00:35:02] expected that AI could do this for me
[00:35:04] now. Um but now it does. in the past. I
[00:35:09] think that would have been my biggest
[00:35:10] advice though is uh just time box it.
[00:35:14] Spend maybe 30 minutes, maybe like
[00:35:15] couple hours max. If you have to like
[00:35:17] dig through code and stuff, um
[00:35:19] definitely reach out to experts and just
[00:35:22] make a list of experts. Talk to all of
[00:35:23] them. Run the design by them. Don't just
[00:35:25] ask them for input. Give them a straw
[00:35:27] man cuz then they can actually like give
[00:35:28] you feedback on it and it's something to
[00:35:30] go off of. Continuing with your career
[00:35:32] story, I think the thing that got you
[00:35:35] promoted to senior staff or IC7 was um
[00:35:38] public groups on Facebook. So I'm
[00:35:41] curious like the story behind your
[00:35:42] involvement in that and you know
[00:35:44] anything interesting that happened at
[00:35:46] that point. Yeah. So public groups was
[00:35:48] one of these projects that came out of
[00:35:49] this uh the scoping for um you know like
[00:35:52] making Facebook groups more about
[00:35:53] communities. There's this like one very
[00:35:55] narrow change that we wanted to make
[00:35:56] that seems so simple on the surface, but
[00:35:58] it was so complex under it. And it's
[00:36:00] just funny like explaining this to
[00:36:02] anyone that wasn't there. They're like,
[00:36:03] "Wait, this is like a oneline change."
[00:36:04] And I'm like, "No, it's not." It's like
[00:36:06] it was very difficult to pull it off.
[00:36:08] And so the change was in order to
[00:36:10] participate in a public Facebook group,
[00:36:12] you no longer have to join first.
[00:36:14] >> So you're saying um you can just view
[00:36:18] like you have read access for all all
[00:36:20] groups essentially or public groups?
[00:36:21] read access for all groups and for some
[00:36:23] groups even comment access. So you can
[00:36:25] comment without joining first.
[00:36:27] >> Interesting.
[00:36:28] >> And this is the thing you know it feels
[00:36:29] like a oneline change and it actually
[00:36:31] was a oneline change but there's all
[00:36:33] these downstream implications that were
[00:36:35] so tricky. So one is um you know in the
[00:36:38] data model there's essentially a field
[00:36:39] in the database that was like group
[00:36:40] member and we had this like really
[00:36:43] intense technical debate about like
[00:36:45] these people that are commenting in a
[00:36:46] group are they group members and the
[00:36:49] model also changed where before to join
[00:36:52] a Facebook group an admin had to approve
[00:36:55] you so there's kind of a vote of
[00:36:57] confidence that you can be in this group
[00:36:59] and then after we switched to this model
[00:37:00] where to join a public Facebook group
[00:37:02] you just you just essentially press like
[00:37:03] follow and we actually went back and
[00:37:05] forth should it be join or follow like
[00:37:06] what's the right verb to describe this
[00:37:08] but it was essentially follow cuz
[00:37:09] there's no reciprocal action you know if
[00:37:12] you follow a group are you a member like
[00:37:14] should you be stored in that same part
[00:37:16] of the database and we we just went back
[00:37:19] and forth on this for a while and I
[00:37:20] remember at the time there was this like
[00:37:22] really senior engineer Bob he was kind
[00:37:24] of the most senior engineer in the in
[00:37:25] the or at the time and he felt very
[00:37:27] strongly that it should not be the same
[00:37:29] thing and he kind of pushed us pretty
[00:37:30] hard um even though it would be a ton of
[00:37:33] engineering work to migrate stuff to
[00:37:35] make at a different thing. And so we did
[00:37:37] this work um because he was actually one
[00:37:39] of the early engineers on Facebook
[00:37:40] group. So he knew it really well. Um and
[00:37:42] he felt pretty strongly. There's a bunch
[00:37:45] of these other like downstream changes
[00:37:46] around uh like moderation and different
[00:37:48] new like admin tooling that admins would
[00:37:50] need to handle kind of the influx of
[00:37:52] spam and things like this. And I
[00:37:54] remember at the time thinking like if
[00:37:56] anyone can make a comment, the comments
[00:37:57] are just going to be like filled up with
[00:37:58] spam. And I had to hard I had a hard
[00:38:01] time kind of convincing people of this.
[00:38:02] And so at some point I built this like
[00:38:04] Monte Carlo like visualization of how
[00:38:06] this would work. And it was just like
[00:38:08] this like really simple kind of like
[00:38:09] scratch pad of you know like a comment
[00:38:11] comes in there's a certain probability
[00:38:12] of it being good or bad and then like
[00:38:14] what actually happens to comments. And I
[00:38:16] think that actually did a pretty good
[00:38:18] job of convincing the integrity teams to
[00:38:20] jump in and help with this. And so at
[00:38:21] the time the pages integrity team jumped
[00:38:23] in and they helped with a comment
[00:38:25] ranking because kind of ranking spam
[00:38:27] comments lower was the main technical
[00:38:29] mechanism to make it so people don't see
[00:38:31] these comments. So there's a bunch of
[00:38:33] these like pretty gnarly downstream
[00:38:34] implications of uh letting people
[00:38:36] participate. There's also this data
[00:38:38] model migration that we're doing. And so
[00:38:40] to do all this, we had to staff a big
[00:38:42] team to um to kind of make this happen.
[00:38:44] And so we hired a new director, Yammen,
[00:38:46] who um hired a bunch of engineers.
[00:38:49] There's a bunch of internal transfers.
[00:38:50] So some of the most senior engineers
[00:38:51] from the org like uh there was like
[00:38:53] Henry Henry Long uh Joe Cham there was
[00:38:57] like a few other engineers and they were
[00:38:59] all working on this and I was the same
[00:39:01] level as them. I was like a you know an
[00:39:03] IC6 at the time and so were they and I
[00:39:07] remember just feeling this kind of
[00:39:08] imposter syndrome of having to kind of
[00:39:11] direct them and kind of point them at
[00:39:12] work knowing kind of in my mind that
[00:39:15] we're the same level even though levels
[00:39:17] are hidden. you kind of you know you
[00:39:18] know through like rumors and stuff who's
[00:39:20] what you know in hindsight I think this
[00:39:22] is sort of like misplaced imposttor
[00:39:24] syndrome because levels don't matter at
[00:39:27] all this is my current view and you know
[00:39:29] some people that are very junior can
[00:39:31] shoot way higher than that and just give
[00:39:33] you amazing results some people that are
[00:39:35] very senior can give you terrible
[00:39:36] results and so the level actually
[00:39:38] doesn't matter that much but at the time
[00:39:41] I remember just like really thinking
[00:39:42] about this and it it was just kind of
[00:39:44] hard to step into this role
[00:39:47] And eventually I did it. And it's funny,
[00:39:50] eventually the thing that got me the
[00:39:51] promo to IC7
[00:39:54] was reversing this decision that Bob did
[00:39:56] cuz he wanted to do this big migration.
[00:39:58] And we did it. And it was just like,
[00:40:00] dude, it was so much work. It was like
[00:40:02] it was like 6 months or a year of work
[00:40:03] or something just migrating just
[00:40:05] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[00:40:06] call sites to to do this correctly. And
[00:40:09] then technically I felt like actually
[00:40:12] what we did is we essentially just added
[00:40:13] an if else at every single one of these
[00:40:15] call sites in the process. We audited
[00:40:17] all the call sites. So we kind of knew
[00:40:19] that it was safe but uh we didn't
[00:40:21] actually change the logic. And so
[00:40:22] actually what we learned is that yes
[00:40:24] member is the right field to model both
[00:40:26] followers and group members. This was
[00:40:28] the right decision. And so I pushed the
[00:40:31] same engineer that did this to then undo
[00:40:32] it. it was the right thing to push this
[00:40:35] engineer because it showed maturity on
[00:40:37] his part that he said yes and was able
[00:40:38] to do it. He also had the most context
[00:40:40] technically so he could do it the best.
[00:40:43] And I think for Bob it made he he felt
[00:40:47] better about me as a technical leader
[00:40:49] because he knew that I was wishing I was
[00:40:51] willing to pull back to to push back on
[00:40:54] um decisions that even senior folks
[00:40:57] make. Um and in the end this was the
[00:41:00] right thing. So we reversed the
[00:41:01] migration. It also took a long time to
[00:41:02] do it, but in the end it made it so
[00:41:05] everyone building on this info could do
[00:41:06] it and everyone wasn't always constantly
[00:41:09] bumping into this like should I use this
[00:41:10] field or or this field.
[00:41:13] >> Yeah, I'm curious about that part cuz
[00:41:15] you had a strong technical disagreement
[00:41:17] with Bob or senior TL. Um, but the
[00:41:21] outcome at the end is actually it seems
[00:41:23] like it strengthened the relationship.
[00:41:25] He was a champion for you in your your
[00:41:28] promotion. So, I'm curious, how would
[00:41:30] you recommend going about strong
[00:41:32] technical disagreement in a way that
[00:41:34] doesn't hurt the relationship?
[00:41:37] >> I think the biggest thing is you have to
[00:41:38] earn it. Yeah. You just have to earn
[00:41:40] trust and it could be as simple as, you
[00:41:43] know, like what I did at the beginning,
[00:41:45] which is just disagreeing and committing
[00:41:47] and showing that I'm willing to do that
[00:41:48] and I'm willing to just execute if
[00:41:50] someone else thinks it's a good idea and
[00:41:52] I kind of look up to them.
[00:41:54] But also you have to kind of show that
[00:41:56] you have good technical judgment. Um but
[00:41:59] you can't really do that until you earn
[00:42:00] trust. So take the time to get that
[00:42:02] trust first.
[00:42:03] >> And then on the imposttor syndrome, um
[00:42:05] leading those engineers that were also
[00:42:07] very strong. Um do you have any advice
[00:42:10] for overcoming imposter syndrome?
[00:42:12] >> Yeah, just don't overthink it. You know,
[00:42:14] no one really knows what they're doing,
[00:42:16] you know, at any level. No one really
[00:42:18] knows. We're all just trying to figure
[00:42:19] it out.
[00:42:20] >> That's easier said than done. Was there
[00:42:22] like a an aha moment where you realize
[00:42:25] actually maybe I do got this or this
[00:42:28] isn't that big of a deal? You know, I
[00:42:30] don't I don't think so really. There
[00:42:31] wasn't a single moment. It just it kind
[00:42:33] of goes away over time. And I think at
[00:42:35] every at every level, it doesn't matter
[00:42:37] what level you're at, you should always
[00:42:38] feel a little bit of imposter syndrome
[00:42:40] cuz if you don't, then you're not
[00:42:42] pushing yourself hard enough.
[00:42:43] >> At this point in your career, you were
[00:42:46] like more and more of a tech lead and
[00:42:48] and therefore you were writing less and
[00:42:50] less code. Um and you mentioned that um
[00:42:55] you know at Meta especially there's
[00:42:57] cases where other functions are underst
[00:42:59] staffed and you view that as an
[00:43:02] opportunity for engineers so to be you
[00:43:04] know more product minded and maybe help
[00:43:06] out with uh you know the PM
[00:43:08] opportunities. I'm curious when would
[00:43:10] you say that you should go that
[00:43:12] direction as opposed to escalating and
[00:43:14] say hey we need more PM support um and
[00:43:18] you know trying to write more code
[00:43:19] instead. Yeah, you have to understand
[00:43:22] the trade-offs. I think this is the this
[00:43:24] is the thing that I think a lot of
[00:43:26] people don't really get when they push
[00:43:27] for stuff or, you know, I think a very
[00:43:30] common failure mode is an engineer will
[00:43:31] push for an idea and then get gets
[00:43:33] frustrated when no one else buys into it
[00:43:35] or wants to fund it. Um, or the
[00:43:37] organization just like doesn't listen or
[00:43:38] their leader doesn't listen. But what
[00:43:41] you have to do is understand the
[00:43:42] trade-offs. And whoever it is that
[00:43:44] you're trying to convince, think of it
[00:43:45] from their point of view. What do they
[00:43:46] care about? What are the projects
[00:43:47] they're working on? What is this
[00:43:48] trade-off against? if they do this
[00:43:51] thing, are are they going to see their
[00:43:53] work as a as a success? Um,
[00:43:57] so I I think I think that's really
[00:43:59] important and for some orgs at sometimes
[00:44:02] they might not have PMs cuz it might
[00:44:04] just not be a very sexy project and so
[00:44:06] it might be really hard to hire and
[00:44:07] maybe the leader is already feeling that
[00:44:09] pain. Maybe for some orgs uh they are
[00:44:12] trying to hire PMs but there's actually
[00:44:13] just much much more important things
[00:44:16] those PMs should go to. For other orgs,
[00:44:19] they might they might actually have like
[00:44:20] too many PMs. And so actually, if you
[00:44:22] ask, that's the right thing to do. Uh
[00:44:25] because they could just take a PM off a
[00:44:26] less important project and put on your
[00:44:28] project cuz it's more important. So I
[00:44:30] think it's really important to kind of
[00:44:31] be situationally aware, understand the
[00:44:34] context you're in, and understand how
[00:44:36] your decision makers think about it. at
[00:44:39] this point and this is kind of the end
[00:44:40] of that part one of your story. You
[00:44:43] credit a lot of your success to again
[00:44:46] the side quests and like having these
[00:44:48] side projects or running list of you
[00:44:50] called them 20% time ideas and I'm
[00:44:54] curious do you have any tips on how to
[00:44:56] find opportunities for engineers? Yeah,
[00:44:58] I think at some point there was probably
[00:45:00] I forget the exact numbers, but there
[00:45:01] was probably like 5000 engineers or
[00:45:03] something like this that were just like
[00:45:04] working on these like side quests that I
[00:45:06] like scoped out and like spun out of
[00:45:07] various points. And so pretty much like
[00:45:09] every week I I'll think of like some
[00:45:11] project, you know, just like on a run or
[00:45:13] something or maybe like while I'm coding
[00:45:15] I think of some idea, I'll just do some
[00:45:17] basic validation and then I'll just ping
[00:45:19] an engineer that I know and be like,
[00:45:20] "Yo, are you interested in this?" And
[00:45:22] then I'll connect them with a couple
[00:45:23] other engineers that might be
[00:45:24] interested. And this kind of added up
[00:45:26] very quickly. I think the for me one way
[00:45:29] that I really think about my work is how
[00:45:32] can I do less of it? And as an engineer,
[00:45:35] our superpower to do this is automation.
[00:45:38] The most tedious stuff you can automate.
[00:45:40] And this is something that's like really
[00:45:41] hard actually for other fields, but for
[00:45:43] us it's this incredible thing that we
[00:45:45] can do. And as it's something a lot of
[00:45:47] engineers don't really do for whatever
[00:45:49] reason, but we should all be doing it
[00:45:51] all the time. It's so important. It's
[00:45:52] leverage. It's like free leverage. And
[00:45:55] so a thing I often did was every time I
[00:45:56] did a code review, if I was commenting
[00:45:59] about a particular kind of issue, maybe
[00:46:01] like a stylistic issue or something, I
[00:46:03] literally had a spreadsheet where I
[00:46:04] would tally up that issue and I posted
[00:46:08] kind of the link to that poll request
[00:46:10] and then I would do this for every code
[00:46:11] review and then when I commented about
[00:46:13] the same kind of thing more than a few
[00:46:14] times, I would just write a lint rule
[00:46:16] for it to just automate that. Um, so
[00:46:19] this is kind of an example of leverage.
[00:46:21] So, and at some point I automated most
[00:46:23] of my code reviews cuz like I just had a
[00:46:25] you know like a flock of lint rolls that
[00:46:27] were just like doing all this work for
[00:46:28] me. And I think this is actually kind of
[00:46:30] similar because all these side quests it
[00:46:32] was improving prod infra and dev infra.
[00:46:34] And these are things that slowed me down
[00:46:36] in my day-to-day coding. And this is why
[00:46:38] like when I was doing west coding this
[00:46:40] was actually very dangerous because as
[00:46:42] an engineer you need to be anchored to
[00:46:43] reality. You need that intuition and if
[00:46:45] you're not in the code anymore then you
[00:46:47] lose it very quickly. It's it's a very
[00:46:48] dangerous place to be in. And so for me
[00:46:50] when I was in the code a lot there was
[00:46:52] all these really cool ideas that came
[00:46:54] out of it and it was leveraged not just
[00:46:56] for me but for the whole edge team
[00:46:57] because again of this principle that if
[00:46:59] you have a problem probably other people
[00:47:01] have it too. And you know I did like YC
[00:47:04] back in the day and in YC they teach you
[00:47:06] that first you build for yourself. You
[00:47:08] have to build like awesome stuff. You
[00:47:10] have to build stuff people love. But if
[00:47:12] you're trying to find a market to build
[00:47:13] for you start by building for yourself.
[00:47:15] And that's a pretty good indicator other
[00:47:16] people probably have that same problem.
[00:47:18] >> Yeah. There was a quote that you wrote
[00:47:19] that I thought was really good. You said
[00:47:21] better engineering is the easiest way to
[00:47:23] grow your network and gain influence as
[00:47:25] an engineer. So I could totally see um
[00:47:28] you had like your
[00:47:31] scope of influence was so much further
[00:47:33] than just the code you're writing
[00:47:35] because you're passing people all these
[00:47:36] great ideas and you know overseeing
[00:47:39] them. It's the the leverage is really uh
[00:47:41] insane.
[00:47:42] >> Absolutely. Yeah. And and it's also just
[00:47:44] like an example of being contextually uh
[00:47:46] was it situationally aware
[00:47:48] >> um because you know at meta at the time
[00:47:50] engineers were evaluated in the
[00:47:52] performance cycle uh we looked at
[00:47:54] project impact people do you remember
[00:47:57] the other
[00:47:58] >> direction
[00:47:58] >> direction
[00:47:59] >> and edge excellence
[00:48:00] >> and edge excellence yeah and the edge
[00:48:02] excellence is a thing that a lot of
[00:48:03] engineers struggled with and so you know
[00:48:06] I was you know one of the people that
[00:48:08] came along and was like hey if you want
[00:48:09] to do edge excellence here's a project
[00:48:11] and people are already incentivized to
[00:48:13] do it. So, they see it as an
[00:48:14] opportunity. And I think this is just
[00:48:16] like I don't know. I think it was a
[00:48:19] chance for me to kind of hone my skills
[00:48:20] about working with people where you
[00:48:23] never ever want to tell anyone what to
[00:48:24] do in any in any context. In a personal
[00:48:27] context, in a work context, everyone
[00:48:28] hates being told what to do. But if you
[00:48:30] understand what a person wants, then you
[00:48:32] can go to the right person with a red
[00:48:34] opportunity and they see it as an
[00:48:35] opportunity. Um, and this just always
[00:48:37] works better for everyone. When I think
[00:48:39] about these 20% time ideas, I mean,
[00:48:42] there's the there's the top of funnel,
[00:48:44] finding the ideas, and then there's
[00:48:46] actually, you know, executing on them,
[00:48:48] the, you know, getting someone to do it
[00:48:50] or whether it's yourself or someone
[00:48:52] else. Um, the thing I'm interested is
[00:48:54] the top of funnel, like how how do you
[00:48:57] source so many ideas um as an engineer
[00:49:00] for these side quests that are
[00:49:02] impactful?
[00:49:03] >> Just common sense.
[00:49:06] I don't know. Maybe maybe spidey sense.
[00:49:08] I I don't know the right word sense like
[00:49:09] how so like what's a what's a concrete
[00:49:11] example?
[00:49:12] >> Yeah, like a really concrete example is
[00:49:15] um you know like I think lint rules are
[00:49:17] a good one. Maybe maybe another one is
[00:49:19] there were all these cases where we had
[00:49:21] sevs because uh Facebook groups were not
[00:49:25] being tested with very large sets of so
[00:49:29] um and so like for example and so kind
[00:49:31] of like this is kind of like a Facebook
[00:49:33] way of saying like you know rows in a
[00:49:34] database. So you could imagine like a
[00:49:36] Facebook group with like 10 million
[00:49:37] members. Like no one's ever tested this.
[00:49:39] There's no like unit test for this. You
[00:49:40] only see it in production. And when I
[00:49:43] looked across the org, I started seeing
[00:49:45] similar cases of this. There's, for
[00:49:46] example, like if you have a profile with
[00:49:48] like 20 million followers, a lot of
[00:49:49] stuff breaks. But obviously like no one
[00:49:51] tests this in an automated way just cuz
[00:49:54] it's kind of annoying to write a unit
[00:49:55] test with this much data. And so there
[00:49:57] there's a bunch of instances of this.
[00:49:59] And then um I pitched an engineer to
[00:50:01] build a way to write unit tests for
[00:50:04] large data sets. So you know like a
[00:50:06] really big object like a group with a
[00:50:08] lot of members, a profile with a lot of
[00:50:09] followers, an event with a lot of
[00:50:10] attendees. And uh I think this infra
[00:50:13] still exists. Um and it's you know it
[00:50:16] prevents a lot of issues and this is
[00:50:17] something where you can scope it and
[00:50:19] then he brought in a bunch of other
[00:50:20] engineers to do the work and and help
[00:50:22] him out with it. So I guess just think
[00:50:24] about the problems that you actually hit
[00:50:25] day-to-day.
[00:50:26] >> Got it. Okay. So think about the
[00:50:28] problems and if you're experiencing that
[00:50:30] problem repeatedly then it's time for
[00:50:33] automation and that's like a great uh
[00:50:35] better engineering project.
[00:50:36] >> Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Like if you hit
[00:50:38] the same problem like two or three times
[00:50:40] you should probably kind of look around
[00:50:42] see if other people are hitting that
[00:50:43] project hitting hitting that problem
[00:50:44] too.
[00:50:45] >> The last leg of your career at Meta um
[00:50:47] this is where you got the E8 promo. I
[00:50:49] know that um you moved orgs. So, you did
[00:50:53] all of your growth in Facebook groups
[00:50:55] and then you moved to Instagram. I'm
[00:50:57] curious, uh, what's the story behind you
[00:51:00] moving orgs to Instagram? At the time,
[00:51:04] um, I was dating, my wife and I were
[00:51:06] still, uh, dating. And, um, she was
[00:51:10] living in Berkeley, I was living in SF.
[00:51:12] And at some point, she's like, I found
[00:51:15] my dream job. And I was like, sweet,
[00:51:17] awesome. And then she was like, we're
[00:51:18] gonna have to move. And I was like,
[00:51:20] okay, great. we we've been dating like 3
[00:51:21] months at the time and uh we were kind
[00:51:25] of deciding like should we like keep
[00:51:26] dating and um and so she was like yeah
[00:51:29] we we would have to we'd have to move if
[00:51:31] you want to like keep dating and I was
[00:51:32] like yeah okay I do let's let's do it
[00:51:35] and then so the job ended up being in
[00:51:36] like rural Japan like it was sort of
[00:51:38] like middle of nowhere and I was trying
[00:51:40] to figure out like how do I do it
[00:51:42] because I really like the work that I
[00:51:43] was doing
[00:51:44] >> and so first I talked to uh like
[00:51:46] Facebook groups leadership and tried to
[00:51:48] set up like a Japan
[00:51:50] out there for for Facebook groups. That
[00:51:52] didn't really work for, you know, a
[00:51:53] bunch of kind of organizational rules.
[00:51:55] Um, then I tried to do this with the VR
[00:51:58] org and it was actually working, but
[00:52:00] then the person that was sponsoring it
[00:52:02] left to go to, I think like YouTube or
[00:52:03] something. Uh, and then at the time Will
[00:52:05] Bailey reached out and he was in the
[00:52:08] Instagram Tokyo office. He was part of
[00:52:09] this like landing team for for Instagram
[00:52:12] and he was like, "Hey, I kind of want to
[00:52:14] grow this office. Do you want to be part
[00:52:15] of that?" And I was like, "Yeah, let's
[00:52:17] let's do it." And I didn't know
[00:52:18] anything. I I didn't even have Instagram
[00:52:20] installed at the time. I'd never used it
[00:52:21] in my life. And um I so I I said yes and
[00:52:26] then I immediately downloaded Instagram
[00:52:27] and then like I moved like I think like
[00:52:29] the next week or something. Um so pretty
[00:52:32] much or or actually you know I think it
[00:52:34] was like a few weeks that that I had in
[00:52:35] the US.
[00:52:37] But I I moved out pretty quickly. Um and
[00:52:40] I actually really fell in love with the
[00:52:43] Instagram culture. Um it was very
[00:52:46] different than Facebook culture. big
[00:52:48] emphasis on building awesome products,
[00:52:50] on on shipping stuff that people don't
[00:52:52] use, on thinking about things not just
[00:52:55] from a data point of view, but also from
[00:52:57] a human point of view and an experience
[00:52:59] point of view. And you can see this in
[00:53:01] the app and in the craft that goes into
[00:53:03] it. It's just completely different
[00:53:04] engineering and product and design
[00:53:07] cultures between the two companies. Um,
[00:53:10] so I learned so much being being on that
[00:53:12] team and that that was such a fun
[00:53:13] journey.
[00:53:14] >> You mentioned the the un shipped part.
[00:53:16] Um, what what is that?
[00:53:19] >> Unchipping is the idea that if you just
[00:53:21] add features to an app, it's cool for
[00:53:24] some small percent of users, but it's
[00:53:26] actually bad for most users that don't
[00:53:28] use the feature. And so, you can think
[00:53:30] of an app where you only add features to
[00:53:32] it. And over time, the features
[00:53:34] accumulate and they add up. And you
[00:53:36] know, if every feature is used by like
[00:53:38] 10% of people, the average user sees a
[00:53:40] bunch of features that they don't use.
[00:53:41] And so, it seems cluttered and
[00:53:43] confusing. And when they open the app,
[00:53:44] they don't know what to do. And uh you
[00:53:47] know like with software fundamentally
[00:53:48] the screen is a limited size. That's the
[00:53:50] limited real estate. Uh there it's a
[00:53:52] limited resource that all the different
[00:53:54] features are competing for. And so by
[00:53:56] adding a feature that's taking the
[00:53:57] opportunity away from you know a
[00:54:01] different feature the person could have
[00:54:02] used. Um and so unshipping is the idea
[00:54:05] that you have to meet some sort of usage
[00:54:07] bar and if a feature doesn't meet that
[00:54:09] bar then we just delete the feature. And
[00:54:11] a small percent of users are going to be
[00:54:13] pissed, but it's actually great for the
[00:54:15] majority of users. And on average, it's
[00:54:18] really great for everyone
[00:54:20] >> at this point in your career. Um, I
[00:54:22] mean, you moved, you didn't just move
[00:54:24] orgs, you moved across the world to work
[00:54:27] at Instagram. And I think when you're
[00:54:30] such a senior tech lead with a lot of
[00:54:31] credibility in your existing org, it's
[00:54:34] much easier to get things done or at
[00:54:35] least influence others cuz they say,
[00:54:37] "Oh, I know Boris and I know his past
[00:54:40] work." But I'm curious, how did you
[00:54:42] build up credibility uh at Instagram uh
[00:54:46] when you were so far away from everyone
[00:54:48] else?
[00:54:50] >> I think a lot of the credit early on
[00:54:52] this goes to like Nam who was Nam Guian,
[00:54:55] he was the he's still the VP of Avenge
[00:54:57] at Instagram and and Jeff Hang um who
[00:55:00] was my director at the time but he now
[00:55:02] he's a VP. Um and you know will I think
[00:55:06] there was a lot of connections made by
[00:55:08] these people. So you know for example
[00:55:10] Nam was like hey you really like doing
[00:55:12] you know working on code quality and
[00:55:13] like tech debt reduction you know which
[00:55:15] we call you know better engineering at
[00:55:17] meta and he kind of connected me with
[00:55:20] the people working on it and this was
[00:55:21] like Lucas Camera and um Gabe and a
[00:55:24] bunch of this bunch of these other folks
[00:55:26] that that were working on this stuff. Uh
[00:55:28] so so those connections were really
[00:55:30] useful. Um, and then I think a lot of it
[00:55:33] was I just had to earn the trust again.
[00:55:36] And honestly, this is a healthy thing to
[00:55:38] do. And I think this is one of the
[00:55:40] really awesome things about meta
[00:55:41] engineering culture that there are not
[00:55:44] titles. And so you kind of have to
[00:55:45] constantly reearn your trust. And you
[00:55:49] know, even if I was a great engineer in
[00:55:50] the past, I may not have been a great
[00:55:51] engineer at Instagram. And if I wasn't,
[00:55:53] then I don't deserve influence. I don't
[00:55:55] deserve to have a really loud voice that
[00:55:58] people listen to. So I had to earn it
[00:56:00] along with everyone else. And so my
[00:56:03] first few weeks I spent a lot of time
[00:56:04] like meeting people, mapping out the
[00:56:06] org, mapping out goals, writing a lot of
[00:56:08] code so I can get to know the codebase.
[00:56:10] But then in Japan it was totally
[00:56:11] different because you know like 400 p.m.
[00:56:14] Tokyo time was like or it was like 9:00
[00:56:18] a.m. Tokyo time was like 7:00 p.m. New
[00:56:19] York time. There was just like no time
[00:56:21] zone over.
[00:56:23] >> It was rough. Yeah. Um, but it was also
[00:56:25] great because I think in the few years
[00:56:27] before I was doing so many meetings and
[00:56:29] docs and all this stuff, I just wasn't
[00:56:30] coding. Um, so I just started to feel
[00:56:33] pretty unhappy cuz like as an engineer
[00:56:35] we code. That's that's what we do. Like
[00:56:37] that's that's the reason we pick this
[00:56:38] job is you like for me like when I write
[00:56:42] code I have an emotional relationship
[00:56:43] with a code and it's something that I
[00:56:45] think about when I'm really deep in a
[00:56:46] problem. I dream about it. So it's just
[00:56:48] so important for me to code. And when I
[00:56:51] wasn't doing this for years, it was sort
[00:56:53] of rough. And I think I was starting to
[00:56:55] burn out a bit. And so, actually, it was
[00:56:57] it was a gift to be in this time zone
[00:56:59] where I literally couldn't do meetings
[00:57:00] cuz people weren't awake or didn't want
[00:57:02] to like, you know, do 9:00 p.m. meetings
[00:57:04] just to talk. Um, so I didn't do any
[00:57:06] more one-on- ones. And this is actually
[00:57:08] still something I I don't do. So, I
[00:57:10] still don't do any standing one-on-
[00:57:11] ones. And I just could spend a lot of
[00:57:13] time coding. And what I realized is I
[00:57:16] was one of a few engineers at Instagram
[00:57:18] at the time that was coding this much.
[00:57:20] Um, you know, people code, but people
[00:57:23] don't code that much because there's all
[00:57:25] this stuff that fills up your time
[00:57:27] there. There's meetings and, you know,
[00:57:29] docs and all these other obligations.
[00:57:31] And
[00:57:33] I was able to do a lot of stuff that I
[00:57:35] think everyone else wanted to do, but
[00:57:38] just didn't have time. Um, and this was
[00:57:40] kind of a superpower in in that org. And
[00:57:43] pretty early on, Nam connected me with
[00:57:46] uh with Joel Pamer, who's still a good
[00:57:47] friend and and and mentor and um he's
[00:57:50] he's at Google now. And we just started
[00:57:53] talking about like you know at the time
[00:57:54] the codebase was written in Python and
[00:57:57] uh there it was sort of rough for a lot
[00:58:00] of different reasons and really the
[00:58:02] codebase should have been moved over to
[00:58:03] hack which is the main Facebook monolith
[00:58:06] you know and this is where all the
[00:58:07] language support is. There's so much
[00:58:08] infra HHVM is just this absolutely
[00:58:11] phenomenal web serving stack. There's
[00:58:13] nothing else like it in terms of like
[00:58:14] efficiency. If you're using GraphQL, you
[00:58:16] absolutely have to use it because it's
[00:58:18] just so optimized for this stuff. And
[00:58:20] Instagram just wasn't using any of this.
[00:58:22] And engineering was suffering. Like in
[00:58:23] the really early days, you know, like
[00:58:25] when like Mikey was at Instagram, really
[00:58:27] basic decisions
[00:58:29] were the the basic principle for
[00:58:31] decisions was do the simple thing that
[00:58:33] works. And this worked really well. But
[00:58:36] then at some point it stopped working
[00:58:37] once you get to like a thousand
[00:58:39] engineers, 2,000 engineers working the
[00:58:40] codebase. and you know many many years
[00:58:42] of techad and products built on top of
[00:58:44] each other you kind of have to do you
[00:58:47] have you have to make slightly different
[00:58:48] decisions than you would have made at
[00:58:49] the start and so even if Python was
[00:58:51] absolutely the right decision at the
[00:58:53] beginning it was not the right decision
[00:58:55] by the time I was there and this was
[00:58:56] painfully obvious as an engineer and I
[00:58:58] think a lot of other people saw this but
[00:59:00] what stopped them was just the amount of
[00:59:01] work it would have taken to to move the
[00:59:03] stuff over and so I just started like
[00:59:05] scoping this and kind of figuring out
[00:59:07] what it would take and so I started by
[00:59:09] finding the people that would disagree
[00:59:10] the
[00:59:11] And there's a bunch of these like info
[00:59:12] old-timers that just thought this was
[00:59:14] like a terrible idea and would never
[00:59:16] work. And so I went to talk to them
[00:59:18] first at like food in New York and you
[00:59:19] know like we got a bunch of beer and
[00:59:21] just got to know them as people before
[00:59:22] we even talked about the technical
[00:59:23] problem. You have to build trust. So I
[00:59:26] had to kind of get to know them as
[00:59:27] people and this was so valuable and this
[00:59:29] is still a lot of my friends today. Um,
[00:59:32] and after building this trust, I also
[00:59:35] learned there was a bunch of other
[00:59:37] people that actually did want to do this
[00:59:38] and were kind of afraid to say it. And
[00:59:40] so these people came out of the woodwork
[00:59:42] too. And eventually we started scoping
[00:59:44] this and this project kind of spun out.
[00:59:46] And it it's actually still going today.
[00:59:47] And there's, you know, many engineers
[00:59:48] working on it. But it but it was it's
[00:59:51] funny because at Facebook I think this
[00:59:52] kind of problem rarely happens because
[00:59:54] the org is so engineering driven. At
[00:59:56] Instagram there were many problems of
[00:59:57] the shape because the org is very
[00:59:59] product driven. So there isn't just a
[01:00:00] lot of time for those engineering driven
[01:00:02] initiatives. this project at some point
[01:00:05] I mean you got it off off the ground
[01:00:07] kind of this bottoms up initiative and
[01:00:09] then at some point it became high pry
[01:00:11] enough where it needed that uh in-person
[01:00:14] support of someone that wasn't in Japan
[01:00:16] and I understand that Jake Bolum is
[01:00:19] someone that you helped onto the project
[01:00:21] and he kind of took more of a a lead
[01:00:23] role um but locationbased and you know
[01:00:27] close to everyone else so he can help
[01:00:28] shepherd it along. Um, I'm curious your
[01:00:31] thoughts on
[01:00:33] that point of delegation. Like when do
[01:00:35] you decide when to delegate something so
[01:00:37] big and when do you decide, oh, I I need
[01:00:40] to still be around and how do you
[01:00:42] navigate that trade-off? Jake is
[01:00:43] amazing. We're we're, you know, we're
[01:00:45] friends. Every time I go to Seattle, we
[01:00:46] we hang out and he's just one of the
[01:00:48] best engineers I know. So, it was
[01:00:50] obvious that he would be a good owner
[01:00:53] for this. The same rules of delegation
[01:00:55] apply as always. So, you know, you
[01:00:57] delegate. You never delegate the thing
[01:00:59] you don't want to do. That's kind of the
[01:01:00] most important rule. You always delegate
[01:01:02] the thing you do want to do and that you
[01:01:04] know well because then you can monitor
[01:01:05] the progress and make sure it's going
[01:01:06] well. Um and there's this really great
[01:01:09] book uh high output management by uh
[01:01:11] Andy Grove. He was a you know old Intel
[01:01:13] CEO and it's just like the most boring
[01:01:15] sounding book ever, but it's just like
[01:01:17] the best. And this is one of the pieces
[01:01:19] of advice is delegate the thing that you
[01:01:21] like to do so then you can monitor
[01:01:23] progress. And so yeah, it's it's kind of
[01:01:25] the same thing. You kind of delegate a
[01:01:26] little bit. you check in. The more trust
[01:01:28] you have, the less you have to check in.
[01:01:30] And with Jake, he's so good technically
[01:01:32] and so proactive. There's just very
[01:01:34] little I had to do. It it was very much
[01:01:35] on track from the start. And so I think
[01:01:37] this coupled with um some other work uh
[01:01:41] large migration to kind of GraphQL or
[01:01:43] modernize some of Instagram's data model
[01:01:46] ended up getting you uh promoted to this
[01:01:48] principal level before you left Meta.
[01:01:51] Um, what was the story behind the
[01:01:53] promotion or anything that you might
[01:01:55] share
[01:01:56] >> that promotion? I think Will in in a
[01:01:58] one-on-one that I had with Will, my
[01:02:00] manager, he was like, "Hey, like I think
[01:02:02] you should like we should put you up for
[01:02:04] IC8." And I was like, "Cool."
[01:02:06] >> And that was pretty much it. I I hadn't
[01:02:08] really thought about it. Yeah, it's not
[01:02:09] something I really asked for.
[01:02:11] >> Um, I think Will was just like does a
[01:02:13] great job of recognizing people and kind
[01:02:15] of advocating for his team and he felt
[01:02:17] that I was ready and yeah, that was
[01:02:19] that. at any point in your journey
[01:02:20] because it sounds like you were impact
[01:02:24] and impact only and growing and your
[01:02:26] leverage and your credibility everything
[01:02:28] was growing and then the promos were
[01:02:30] this lagging thing where they just oh
[01:02:32] they kept happening as a byproduct. Um
[01:02:35] I'm curious though to structure your
[01:02:38] thinking about how to um get more
[01:02:41] leverage or kind of have more impact.
[01:02:44] Did did you ever think about the levels
[01:02:46] or would you say that it's not good to
[01:02:49] think about like oh what's the next
[01:02:51] level more think in terms of just I
[01:02:54] don't know leverage or impact or
[01:02:55] something else you have to think about
[01:02:57] what levels are for right levels exist
[01:03:00] so that the company can communicate to
[01:03:02] an engineer what it is they expect the
[01:03:04] engineer to do it also exists so that
[01:03:07] there's some accountability so for
[01:03:09] example in performance reviews the
[01:03:11] engineer at a particular level you can
[01:03:12] compare them to another engineer at that
[01:03:14] same level and also sometimes on the
[01:03:15] finance side different engineers or you
[01:03:17] know the pit costs a different amount.
[01:03:19] So you can kind of think about what kind
[01:03:20] of portfolio you want. So you know
[01:03:23] levels it kind of exists for company
[01:03:24] reasons and not for engineer reasons.
[01:03:27] And for me it's just never the way that
[01:03:29] I thought about any of this. Like the
[01:03:31] thing that I like to do is work on
[01:03:33] interesting projects. I like to figure
[01:03:35] out the problems and solve them. I like
[01:03:36] to um just make the things that people
[01:03:40] use delightful like the products that
[01:03:41] they use delightful. this this is what
[01:03:43] really motivates me. So for me, this was
[01:03:46] just never really the way I thought
[01:03:47] about it. And I I don't know like my my
[01:03:49] first week at Facebook, I was like an
[01:03:50] IC4 and I was I had like all these ideas
[01:03:53] for stuff that we should build. And so I
[01:03:54] just started writing like product
[01:03:56] briefs. And then I remember I went to
[01:03:57] like the VP of like connectivity and
[01:03:59] like pitched him some idea and he just
[01:04:01] didn't understand it at all and thought
[01:04:02] it was terrible. And then like that
[01:04:04] didn't work. And then I had another idea
[01:04:06] for messenger and like I went and like
[01:04:07] pitched that and like they also like
[01:04:09] didn't do it. But then they actually did
[01:04:11] end up building it a couple years later,
[01:04:12] this particular idea. So yeah, for me
[01:04:15] it's just like, you know, what are what
[01:04:17] are the cool ideas and like how can I
[01:04:18] help and who else is interested in this
[01:04:20] stuff and how can we build build cool
[01:04:22] stuff? You left Meta to go to Anthropic
[01:04:25] and I'm very curious what was your
[01:04:27] thinking about going to anthropic.
[01:04:30] >> I remember using chatt for the first
[01:04:32] time when it came out. This was uh you
[01:04:34] know this was like year years ago and I
[01:04:36] remember I was I was in Japan. I was the
[01:04:39] only engineer in my town. I was the only
[01:04:40] person that spoke English in my town and
[01:04:43] there's just no one that I could talk to
[01:04:44] about tech stuff and I remember every
[01:04:46] every morning I read Hacker News and I I
[01:04:49] remember using Chat GPT and I was just
[01:04:53] like blown away by by the product and
[01:04:56] just this this feeling that it gave me
[01:04:57] of just nowadays we take it for granted
[01:05:00] but you know LMS are just magic. It's
[01:05:02] just this absolutely incredible
[01:05:04] technology and I think now my view of it
[01:05:06] has shifted. It's like to me it's LMS
[01:05:09] are this kind of alien life form that we
[01:05:11] get to nurture and we get to bring into
[01:05:13] existence. It's not just a technology.
[01:05:16] And I'm also a really big reader. I I
[01:05:18] read a lot of sci-fi. That's kind of my
[01:05:20] my big genre. Um and so at the time I
[01:05:23] was like, "Oh my god, I have to work on
[01:05:24] this stuff." And you know, what are what
[01:05:26] are the labs that are that are working
[01:05:27] on it? So I went to talk to friends
[01:05:29] working, you know, at various labs. And
[01:05:31] I feel like when I came to Anthropic, I
[01:05:33] remember my first lunch. This was with
[01:05:34] Ben man, who's uh one of the founders
[01:05:36] here. And we were sitting at lunch with
[01:05:38] like him and a bunch of other people.
[01:05:40] And I mentioned this like weird like
[01:05:42] sci-fi book that I like. Uh it was I
[01:05:44] think it was like by Greg Egan or
[01:05:46] something. It's like hard sci-fi author.
[01:05:47] And I've literally never met anyone
[01:05:49] that's read this book. And at the table
[01:05:52] I kind of gave an anecdote from it. And
[01:05:54] everyone around the table was like, "Oh
[01:05:56] yeah, yeah, that book was good, but like
[01:05:57] what about this other book?" And so it
[01:05:59] was just like this group of people of
[01:06:00] these like intense sci-fi nerds, these
[01:06:03] people that think so deeply about these
[01:06:04] same problems I care about. And I I
[01:06:08] think the other part for me was how
[01:06:10] you're reading a lot of sci-fi, you kind
[01:06:12] of get a sense of, you know, in a very
[01:06:14] speculative way how this thing can play
[01:06:16] out. AI is just so transformative to
[01:06:18] society. I think it's hitting
[01:06:20] engineering first and it's going to hit
[01:06:22] every part of society. It's going to
[01:06:24] affect everything. And we're seeing the
[01:06:26] very first waves of this right now.
[01:06:28] And I think I just, you know, like I I
[01:06:30] read enough that I kind of knew the bad
[01:06:32] ways that this can play out and there
[01:06:33] can be so many ways this thing goes
[01:06:35] wrong. And so for me, anthropic was just
[01:06:38] the obvious choice cuz I wanted to be at
[01:06:40] a place where in the tiniest way I could
[01:06:43] make sure this thing goes well, which is
[01:06:45] as an engineer, this is all I can do.
[01:06:47] Um, and it it's funny. I think like
[01:06:50] before I joined, I sort of took safety
[01:06:51] seriously. Like you know, it's like a
[01:06:53] thing that can happen. And you know at
[01:06:54] Meta it was always seen as this kind of
[01:06:56] tax where integrity teams and you know
[01:06:58] and so on they kind of like they get you
[01:07:00] to do stuff but it's not really the
[01:07:02] thing anyone's really excited to do
[01:07:03] because it's not the product. And so
[01:07:05] this was kind of my view of safety
[01:07:06] before but at the same time I kind of
[01:07:08] speculatively knew that it could be kind
[01:07:10] of a very different thing. And now being
[01:07:12] at Anthropic,
[01:07:14] I know it's completely different and I
[01:07:16] see every model that comes out and kind
[01:07:18] of the new risks that come with it and
[01:07:20] how as a company we put our money where
[01:07:23] our mouth is, you know, in terms of like
[01:07:26] how much compute goes to safety research
[01:07:28] and alignment research in terms of like
[01:07:30] how many people work on this. We've held
[01:07:32] up model releases in the past because we
[01:07:34] did not know that they were safe and so
[01:07:36] we had to make sure that they were safe
[01:07:37] before. Um and I think also like with
[01:07:40] Opus 4 the risks just went way up like
[01:07:42] if the model can design you know like
[01:07:44] bioviruses and can do these things that
[01:07:46] are like really really dangerous and
[01:07:49] it's not just like you know like the
[01:07:51] baseline risk is something like election
[01:07:53] manipulation. This is something that you
[01:07:54] know like at was a really big deal. This
[01:07:56] is sort of a risk for kind of a
[01:07:58] low-level model. As the models get more
[01:08:00] dangerous, the risks get higher and very
[01:08:02] quickly you get into this territory
[01:08:04] where people can use the model to build
[01:08:06] things that are actually dangerous for
[01:08:08] humanity. Like not not just like you
[01:08:10] know like uh you know politics in a
[01:08:12] country but like literally the existence
[01:08:14] of humanity. Um and these this is not
[01:08:16] sci-fi. This is a real risk today that
[01:08:18] we actively have to fight. Um and so for
[01:08:21] me just like getting to be a part of
[01:08:22] this and getting to contribute a little
[01:08:24] bit this this is just what put me over.
[01:08:27] What about when you joined? When you
[01:08:29] think about the engineering cultures
[01:08:31] that you came from compared to
[01:08:33] enthropic, were there any really jarring
[01:08:35] differences?
[01:08:37] Yeah, I would say the two things. One is
[01:08:40] still being a startup, there's a lot of
[01:08:41] common sense. Um, and it's funny. I
[01:08:44] think this is something every big
[01:08:45] company loses and it's sort of this
[01:08:47] thing you have to fight because over
[01:08:50] time the decision makers get more
[01:08:51] distant from the impact of their
[01:08:53] decision, whether it's the product or
[01:08:55] the people or whatever. you have to come
[01:08:57] up with all sorts of processes to bring
[01:08:58] them closer and to improve the quality
[01:09:00] of decision-m but still being at a
[01:09:02] startup uh everyone just has common
[01:09:04] sense and generally just does the right
[01:09:06] thing. So I don't have to spend a lot of
[01:09:08] time convincing people to do stuff. If
[01:09:10] we should just do something it's it's
[01:09:11] obvious and everyone just does it. I
[01:09:14] think the second thing is for me
[01:09:16] personally something that I learned over
[01:09:18] time motivates me the most is mission.
[01:09:20] It's so important and it's the thing
[01:09:23] that keeps me going to work every day
[01:09:25] excited to go to work every day. It's
[01:09:27] the thing that makes me like code on the
[01:09:29] weekends because I want to do it, not
[01:09:30] because there's a deadline. Um, and so I
[01:09:33] I felt this a lot actually in Facebook
[01:09:34] groups. It it was very missionoriented.
[01:09:36] And um, for a long time, Jen Dolski was
[01:09:39] the VP and she she used to be the CEO of
[01:09:40] change.org. And so she ran all of
[01:09:43] Facebook groups like a nonprofit. She
[01:09:44] had like a theory of change and this
[01:09:46] theory about how you want to connect
[01:09:47] people to like-minded people to form
[01:09:49] communities and it was just so
[01:09:51] motivating to work on that. And I feel
[01:09:53] like at Instagram, you know, maybe
[01:09:54] because of the geographic distance or
[01:09:56] maybe something else, I just never quite
[01:09:58] felt that same mission. Um, but I feel
[01:10:00] like at anthropic I feel that so
[01:10:01] strongly and um that's probably the most
[01:10:04] exciting thing for me. I know that you
[01:10:07] know you're you're credited as the
[01:10:08] creator of Cloud Code and I think you've
[01:10:11] you've told that story in many places um
[01:10:14] but I'm kind of curious uh I was talking
[01:10:17] with a friend about what the environment
[01:10:19] was like when cloud code came and there
[01:10:22] were actually a lot of competing
[01:10:24] existing tools that hooked into the
[01:10:26] model and I'm curious what is it that
[01:10:28] was different about cloud code that kind
[01:10:32] of won out and just caught like wildfire
[01:10:34] internally
[01:10:36] At the time coding looked very
[01:10:37] different. If you thought about AI
[01:10:39] coding, people thought about like
[01:10:40] autocomplete. That was essentially it. I
[01:10:42] think there was like some very early
[01:10:44] agents, but it was kind of a secondary
[01:10:46] thing next to the auto autocomplete. And
[01:10:49] often times it was used for Q&A. Um it
[01:10:52] wasn't really used for coding. And so
[01:10:54] when people thought about AI for coding,
[01:10:56] it was just a completely different
[01:10:57] product that you imagined. You know, it
[01:10:58] was like tab to autocomplete.
[01:11:01] And I thought that's what it was. And I
[01:11:04] thought that was kind of the state of
[01:11:06] it. And then um Ben who um was my
[01:11:10] manager at the time uh he pushed me to
[01:11:13] think a little bit bigger and he I think
[01:11:16] really internalized cuz you know he was
[01:11:17] there from the beginning of of Enthropic
[01:11:19] and you know he was like at at other
[01:11:21] labs before and so I think he really
[01:11:23] understood the scaling laws kind of
[01:11:25] internally about how quickly the models
[01:11:26] are improving and so he actually pushed
[01:11:28] me really hard to be like don't build
[01:11:30] for the model of today build for the
[01:11:32] model 6 months from now. Um, and so
[01:11:35] honestly for a long time quad code was
[01:11:37] not a great product and even when it was
[01:11:39] used internally I used it for maybe like
[01:11:41] 10% of my code or something like this.
[01:11:43] You know use it sometimes but it really
[01:11:44] just can't do most things cuz the model
[01:11:46] is not capable enough and then at some
[01:11:48] point we released uh set and opus 4 and
[01:11:51] I think this was maybe March of this
[01:11:53] year and the product just worked and we
[01:11:56] saw this in kind of the usage data and I
[01:11:58] saw this in my own coding. I started to
[01:12:01] be able to use it for probably like half
[01:12:02] of half of my code. And this was totally
[01:12:05] borne out because this was actually like
[01:12:07] literally 6 months after starting the
[01:12:08] project. This was the timeline. And you
[01:12:11] know at this point most of quad code is
[01:12:13] written using quad code. I think it's
[01:12:14] like 80 or 90%. If you look at teams at
[01:12:17] anthropic, there's some teams that you
[01:12:19] know like 90% of their code is written
[01:12:21] using quad code. Um this is not just our
[01:12:23] team. And if you look at the impact on
[01:12:26] productivity even though anthropic has
[01:12:28] tripled I think since the start of the
[01:12:30] year uh productivity per engineer
[01:12:32] measured in you know like poor cost we
[01:12:34] were talking about this before has grown
[01:12:35] like almost 70% per engineer because of
[01:12:38] quad code and so you know like as a
[01:12:42] product person I usually think a step
[01:12:44] ahead and I think being at a lab you
[01:12:46] have to actually think kind of
[01:12:47] differently you have to think a step
[01:12:48] ahead um not two steps ahead um but also
[01:12:51] you have to be really aware of the model
[01:12:53] and kind of the exponential potential
[01:12:54] that we're on.
[01:12:55] >> Did you see the recent interview with
[01:12:57] Karpathy?
[01:12:58] >> I haven't had a chance to watch it yet.
[01:12:59] >> Okay. So, one thing that he said in the
[01:13:02] podcast was kind of like a you know
[01:13:05] pushing back a little bit because
[01:13:08] um basically vibe coding although it has
[01:13:11] a lot of miraculous results because of
[01:13:13] what it can generate there's also a lot
[01:13:15] of like he said like slop or you know
[01:13:18] there's like some drawbacks. So I'm
[01:13:20] curious like how do you think about that
[01:13:22] when the model produces um a lot of code
[01:13:26] but maybe it's not exactly how you'd
[01:13:28] like it or maybe the end result has some
[01:13:30] non-obvious problems with it.
[01:13:34] AI coding is a tool like every other
[01:13:36] tool that we use and you have to learn
[01:13:38] how to use it. So I think one of the
[01:13:40] most you know Karpathy obviously like he
[01:13:42] knows how to code. I think a lot of
[01:13:44] people that are new to this kind of
[01:13:46] tool, they tend to just ask it to do
[01:13:48] stuff that's a little bit too big or
[01:13:50] they hold a different bar for the
[01:13:51] model's code versus their own code. Um,
[01:13:53] and so something that I do for the team
[01:13:55] is for the quad code team, we have the
[01:13:57] same exact bar regardless of whether the
[01:13:59] code was written by the model or by a
[01:14:01] human. And so if the code sucks, we're
[01:14:03] not going to merge it. It's the same
[01:14:04] exact bar and you just ask the model to
[01:14:06] improve the code and and make it better.
[01:14:08] I think there's also kind of different
[01:14:10] ways of wielding these tools. Sometimes
[01:14:12] you want to vibe code. Uh, and this is
[01:14:14] really important for throwaway code and
[01:14:15] prototypes, code that's not in the
[01:14:17] critical path. And you know, I do this
[01:14:19] all the time, but it's it's definitely
[01:14:21] not the thing you want to do all the
[01:14:22] time. Um, because you want maintainable
[01:14:24] code sometimes. Um, you want to be very
[01:14:26] thoughtful about every line sometimes.
[01:14:28] So the way the the problem depending on
[01:14:31] the problem, you want a a different
[01:14:33] approach. And so, you know, there's like
[01:14:35] a set of approaches that I that I'll
[01:14:37] use. Like sometimes I'll vibe code
[01:14:38] stuff. Um, this is actually quite rare.
[01:14:40] It's actually mostly for like prototypes
[01:14:42] and things like that that are throwaway
[01:14:43] code. Usually I pair with a model to
[01:14:46] make to to write code. And so first we
[01:14:48] align on a plan, you know. So this is
[01:14:50] like shift tab in quad code to get into
[01:14:52] plan mode. And first the the model will
[01:14:55] make a plan, then I'll see the code, and
[01:14:56] then I I might ask it to improve the
[01:14:58] code or clean it up or so on. But it's a
[01:14:59] very involved process. I'm pairing with
[01:15:01] the model. We're working together to to
[01:15:03] write this code. And then sometimes I'll
[01:15:06] still write the code by hand. So you
[01:15:08] know there's some parts of our core
[01:15:09] query loop where I have very strong
[01:15:11] opinions about like you know things like
[01:15:13] the names of parameters or kind of like
[01:15:15] on which particular line of code is um
[01:15:17] some some code is and so for this I'll
[01:15:19] still write it by hand. I think the the
[01:15:21] thing though is
[01:15:24] the models I think are still overall not
[01:15:26] great at coding. I think there's still
[01:15:29] so much room to improve and this is the
[01:15:32] worst it's ever going to be. But it's
[01:15:34] just insane to me to think a year back
[01:15:36] where the state of AI coding was, you
[01:15:38] know, like type ahead and it's just a
[01:15:41] completely different world. And you sort
[01:15:43] of think about like where this is headed
[01:15:45] and kind of what's about to happen and
[01:15:47] what this looks like over the next few
[01:15:48] months and few years. And yeah, I think
[01:15:51] for me what keeps me really excited
[01:15:53] about it is just having the context
[01:15:55] about this trajectory that we're on.
[01:15:57] When people hear cloud code, they think
[01:15:58] about coding, but um there's many use
[01:16:02] cases outside of just software
[01:16:04] engineering like querying data for like
[01:16:07] data scientist. What are your thoughts
[01:16:08] when you think of cloud code for
[01:16:10] everything? It was the craziest thing
[01:16:12] when I walked in. I remember walking
[01:16:14] into the office like maybe it was like 6
[01:16:16] months ago or something and our data
[01:16:18] scientist Brandon had cloud code up on
[01:16:20] his computer. He like sits next to us
[01:16:22] and I'm like, "Dude, what are you doing?
[01:16:23] Are you like trying it out?" And he's
[01:16:24] like, "No, no, I'm like it's like doing
[01:16:25] my work." I was like, "What?" So he like
[01:16:27] he figured out how to like use a
[01:16:28] terminal and like how to install Node.js
[01:16:30] and then he installed quad code and then
[01:16:32] it was writing a bunch of SQL and like
[01:16:33] doing analysis for him. And now when I
[01:16:36] walked by kind of the the the data
[01:16:38] scientists that sit next to us, every
[01:16:40] person has like a bunch of cloud codes
[01:16:42] up at the same time. It's not just one
[01:16:44] anymore. And they're doing all sorts of
[01:16:46] stuff. They're like writing SQL and you
[01:16:49] know kind of crunching data. Um they're
[01:16:51] writing DBT pipelines and they're
[01:16:53] writing code. Um, so I think there's all
[01:16:55] these applications outside of coding and
[01:16:58] it's just so cool to see how people are
[01:17:02] are using this for all sorts of stuff
[01:17:04] and there's even like totally
[01:17:06] nontechnical users like half of our
[01:17:08] sales team at Anthropic uses quad code
[01:17:10] to do their work like they they can like
[01:17:12] connect it to Salesforce and they can
[01:17:14] connect it to different data sources and
[01:17:16] you know like they can do their work
[01:17:17] this way. So it it's just so cool to see
[01:17:19] this is not how we designed it. This is
[01:17:21] not the intent. When I hear cloud code,
[01:17:24] I also think of Codeex, one of the
[01:17:26] biggest competitors. And I'm curious,
[01:17:29] what are your thoughts on the
[01:17:30] competition with Codeex and OpenAI? What
[01:17:33] does Cloud Code do better? Um, and also
[01:17:36] I'm curious like the stickiness of these
[01:17:38] AI products like, you know, what keeps
[01:17:40] people in cloud code versus um Codeex
[01:17:43] for instance.
[01:17:44] >> You know, I'm not totally sure. I don't
[01:17:46] personally, I don't really use the other
[01:17:47] products.
[01:17:48] >> Okay. Okay. For me, you know, like the
[01:17:51] thing I tell the team is like it's so
[01:17:53] easy to get sidetracked by, you know,
[01:17:55] looking at competitors. And I think this
[01:17:57] is something that I saw that big
[01:17:59] companies fall into this failure mode a
[01:18:00] lot where
[01:18:02] because there's so many competitors and
[01:18:04] it's so easy to see the thing you could
[01:18:06] build by just, you know, copying it.
[01:18:09] It's a little bit harder to come up with
[01:18:11] novel ideas and things that solve the
[01:18:15] user need better. And so the thing that
[01:18:17] I try really hard to do and the thing
[01:18:19] that I nudge our team to do is don't get
[01:18:22] sidetracked by all these other you know
[01:18:24] products there's always going to be a
[01:18:25] lot and the more there are the bigger a
[01:18:28] sign of success that is for us and the
[01:18:31] thing we stay laser focused on is
[01:18:33] solving our problems and solving
[01:18:34] anthropic researchers problems and
[01:18:36] solving our users problems. Coming to
[01:18:38] the end of the conversation I just want
[01:18:41] to ask a few career reflections. Um, one
[01:18:43] thing I was curious about when I was
[01:18:45] looking is that um, you didn't have a CS
[01:18:47] degree or a computer science degree and
[01:18:50] you've, yeah, you've become such a
[01:18:52] strong software engineer and so I was
[01:18:54] curious is there any part in your career
[01:18:57] where you know it might have held you
[01:18:59] back in any way or do you think it's not
[01:19:01] necessary or relevant?
[01:19:03] >> Yeah, I studied economics and I actually
[01:19:05] dropped out to to startups.
[01:19:08] Um, you know, for me, anything that you
[01:19:11] do, you learn on the job and I think
[01:19:14] programming is just such a practical
[01:19:16] skill. I couldn't imagine, you know, the
[01:19:18] kinds of things you learn in school. And
[01:19:20] like, you know, if you're if you're like
[01:19:21] in a data structures class or something,
[01:19:23] you're like running this, but you
[01:19:24] haven't like built a product, how is it
[01:19:26] relevant at all? Um, so I don't know. I
[01:19:30] think my recommendation would be to
[01:19:32] people like learn coding practically.
[01:19:34] It's a very practical skill. And then if
[01:19:36] you want to go back and learn the theory
[01:19:37] after, go do that. Um, but personally,
[01:19:39] I've never felt like it it's held me
[01:19:40] back at all.
[01:19:41] >> What about productivity tips? So, I saw
[01:19:44] that you said you work roughly 9 to 6
[01:19:47] every day and you only type with two
[01:19:50] fingers, but your output is ridiculous.
[01:19:53] I mean, you have all these side projects
[01:19:55] and of course, your main stuff's no
[01:19:56] joke. So, what's your top productivity
[01:19:59] tips or how do you maintain that? Yeah,
[01:20:01] I think I think nowadays my tips are
[01:20:03] very different than what I would have
[01:20:04] said a couple years ago. Nowadays, the
[01:20:06] tip is just learn how to use quad code
[01:20:08] and learn how to run a bunch of quad
[01:20:09] codes to do stuff like um you know we
[01:20:12] launched plugins like a couple weeks ago
[01:20:14] and Daisy who's one of the the the
[01:20:16] engineer that built it she just had her
[01:20:19] quads like set up a sauna board make a
[01:20:21] tasks and then she had a swarm of like
[01:20:23] 20 clouds just like build plugins over
[01:20:25] the weekend and uh you know she ran it
[01:20:27] in like a docker container dangerous
[01:20:28] mode and it was done after a couple
[01:20:30] days. Um and this is the kind of thing
[01:20:33] that is the future of engineering. Um,
[01:20:35] and I think nowadays when we talk about
[01:20:38] tips for productivity, it's learn how to
[01:20:40] use claude in order to automate toil and
[01:20:43] also how to use a bunch of quads
[01:20:46] together to to do uh work. So you're
[01:20:48] kind of orchestrating instead of
[01:20:50] manually writing code. Um, I think years
[01:20:54] ago my tips would have been really
[01:20:55] different. It would have been a lot more
[01:20:56] prosaic than that, you know, like about
[01:20:58] like blocking off time and and things
[01:21:00] like this.
[01:21:02] >> Yeah, it's it's interesting with cloud
[01:21:03] code. I wonder what that does for you
[01:21:05] know the famous um like maker schedule
[01:21:08] versus like manager schedule. It feels
[01:21:11] like what you just said is that software
[01:21:13] engineers becoming more like a manager
[01:21:16] style of working where you got a fleet
[01:21:19] of these cloud codes and you're not you
[01:21:21] don't need deep focus to move forward.
[01:21:24] You need context switching across like
[01:21:26] 20 different things. Um so do you no
[01:21:29] longer have big focus blocks for coding
[01:21:31] or what are your thoughts on that? not
[01:21:33] as much. I tend to code on the weekends
[01:21:36] also. Um so I love the quiet time. Um
[01:21:39] but yeah, otherwise I'll kind of start
[01:21:41] every morning I open Quad Code and um
[01:21:43] you know like the mobile app. It's like
[01:21:44] there's like a code tab in Quad now. We
[01:21:46] we just launched this this week, but
[01:21:48] we've been kind of using it for a while.
[01:21:49] And so every morning I wake up and I
[01:21:51] start a few agents to just like start my
[01:21:52] code for the day. And it's crazy because
[01:21:55] I if you'd asked me like 6 months ago if
[01:21:57] this is how I would code, I would be
[01:21:58] like, "No, are you like are you crazy?
[01:22:00] Like how can you code in this way?" But
[01:22:01] it actually works. like this is here and
[01:22:03] it works and this is how I write a lot
[01:22:04] of my code now. And I'll I'll start a
[01:22:07] few agents then you know when I get to a
[01:22:08] computer I'll kind of check in on the
[01:22:10] status. Sometimes I'll just merge it if
[01:22:11] the code looks good. Sometimes I'll like
[01:22:13] pull it locally and kind of teleport to
[01:22:15] to edit a little bit. Um but yeah and
[01:22:19] and I think like you're going to talk to
[01:22:20] Fiona later and I think for her from
[01:22:24] what she told me she hasn't coded in you
[01:22:26] know like a decade but she's writing
[01:22:28] code like multiple times a week now
[01:22:30] because as a manager even though her
[01:22:32] schedule was insane uh she can still use
[01:22:35] the mobile app and she can use web and
[01:22:37] you know she can still open a terminal
[01:22:38] to just kind of write write code for
[01:22:41] her. Um, so yeah, it's it's just crazy
[01:22:45] like we get to live through this
[01:22:46] transition where the thing that we do
[01:22:50] and like the thing that I grew up on,
[01:22:51] it's just totally changing and yeah,
[01:22:53] it's just so cool. Like it's becoming
[01:22:55] accessible to everyone.
[01:22:57] >> And then last question for you is um
[01:23:00] knowing everything that you know now in
[01:23:02] your career, if you could go back to
[01:23:04] yourself when you just entered the
[01:23:05] industry and give yourself some advice,
[01:23:08] what would you say?
[01:23:10] Just use common sense.
[01:23:14] I think there's a lot of stuff in a
[01:23:16] especially in big companies that pulls
[01:23:18] you away from common sense. There's a
[01:23:20] lot of this like organia. Things are
[01:23:22] this way because they have been this
[01:23:24] way. There's a lot of misaligned
[01:23:26] incentives. There's also a lot of good
[01:23:27] things, but there's the these things
[01:23:28] also. So, it it's just really important
[01:23:31] to use common sense for this. And you
[01:23:33] know, early on in my career, I was kind
[01:23:35] of starting a bunch of startups and
[01:23:36] worked at a lot of startups. And I think
[01:23:39] there too, it's the same thing. Kind of
[01:23:42] use common sense to figure out what the
[01:23:43] market wants and what users want to
[01:23:44] build it. So yeah, just like trust
[01:23:48] yourself and and develop your common
[01:23:50] sense.
[01:23:51] >> Awesome. Well, thank you so much, Boris,
[01:23:53] for your time. Really appreciate it.
