[00:00:01] How many of you know high schoolers who struggle 
to read? I know I do. Our team, Gary, decided,  
[00:00:09] but that this wasn't just a personal problem. It's 
a national one. And that's why we created Phonics,  
[00:00:15] a smart, engaging solution to help older 
students become stronger readers. Right now,  
[00:00:19] over 70% of eighth graders read below proficiency. 
And nearly one in five high school graduates can't  
[00:00:25] read at all. Worse, many teachers feel unprepared 
or unsupportive when it comes to teaching reading  
[00:00:30] in their subject areas. Students are falling 
through the cracks, especially in underresourced  
[00:00:36] schools. This issue affects more than just 
students. Teachers in underresourced schools  
[00:00:40] are often expected to teach reading without the 
training or time to do it effectively. Parents,  
[00:00:46] especially in lowincome households, may not have 
the tools to help out their kids at home. And at  
[00:00:51] the center of it all are the teens. They're 
the ones navigating high school without the  
[00:00:55] reading skills they need to succeed. And that's 
why we made teens our core focus because A,  
[00:01:01] they're working with outdated learning tools that 
don't match their interest or learning styles. B,  
[00:01:06] many come from lowincome schools that lack the 
funding for personalized reading support. And C,  
[00:01:11] most struggle with low reading levels and a lack 
of foundational skills, which makes it even harder  
[00:01:16] to keep up in class. With all that information, 
we built a new and inclusive approach to learning.  
[00:01:23] Phonics, an AI powered app that gives a 
gamified way to fight teen illiteracy.
[00:01:31] The user will be prompted to select their role. 
Here, I'll select student. The student will then  
[00:01:36] be prompted to select their three favorite 
topics out of a list. Then the student will  
[00:01:42] be tested on words in those topics to 
judge their current reading level. Bowl
[00:01:50] track. Dragon students will also test their 
skills by speaking sentences. I'll press the  
[00:01:57] start speaking button. John went to the store. 
Then the app will grade the response based on  
[00:02:02] accuracy using AI. Parents will also have the 
chance to view their children's progress. We plan  
[00:02:07] to implement a similar feature for teachers. The 
use students will learn new words and phrases in  
[00:02:14] a flashcard game that will use AI to judge their 
accuracy. The student will also be able to choose  
[00:02:19] their favorite topics to make the experience more 
enjoyable and tailored to them. The app should be  
[00:02:24] gamified in order to keep the student engaged and 
excited to learn new words every single day. They  
[00:02:29] could also be tested with Mad Lib style paragraphs 
that are generated with AI and incorporate the  
[00:02:34] user's problem words in order to make sure that 
the user is constantly hitting those problem  
[00:02:39] areas and improving on their pronunciation. But 
we will not have any voice chat or live tutors.  
[00:02:45] On a technical note, currently we are using the 
chatbot component and using chat GBT to grade the  
[00:02:50] students pronunciation, but in the future we 
would de develop an in-house model that would  
[00:02:56] analyze the students vocal pattern itself in 
order to prevent any biases in the grading. But  
[00:03:01] my teammate will tell you more about this later. 
PhonX follows a premium model offering students  
[00:03:07] free access to our AI powered flashcard game, 
proprietary assessments and testing/quizzes and  
[00:03:13] adaptive learning paths tailored to individual 
progress. We are currently showcasing our basic  
[00:03:18] model. The premium version includes all of our 
free features, plus AIdriven Mad Libs testing,  
[00:03:24] bonus interactive learning games, and dynamic 
translation, which is all available for only  
[00:03:29] $20 a month or through intellectual property 
licensing for schools and educators. We will  
[00:03:35] discuss the premium features later on 
as it's an extension for the future.
[00:03:42] We initially assumed that our end users were 
students who were struggling with phonics and  
[00:03:46] reading on grade level. However, our research 
showed that many of these students are in  
[00:03:50] underresourced or marginalized communities. 
So, we reached out to students and teachers  
[00:03:54] on Discord and Reddit. We asked questions about 
how students are currently learning ELA. We found  
[00:03:59] out that one student struggled with speaking 
English because it was their second language.  
[00:04:03] Another stated that educ educational games help 
them learn best. One teacher even explained that  
[00:04:09] uh students were most engaged with interactive 
digital platforms. That's why we decided to  
[00:04:13] implement an AI powered phonics feature in 
a gamified approach, particularly with an  
[00:04:18] interactive flash flashcard game. These features 
will make our app both accessible and engaging  
[00:04:23] to keep students want to improve and learn more. 
After researching the top competitors in phonics  
[00:04:30] learning, we separated their features into five 
main categories being learner targeting, AI  
[00:04:34] powered feedback, gamified learning, personalized 
content, and accessibility. Many apps currently  
[00:04:38] only provide support for young kids and not those 
who need help as they have speech impediments,  
[00:04:43] which is why we made phonics enjoyable for all 
ages and abilities. Additionally, with our AI  
[00:04:48] power feedback, we're able to give users instant 
feedback on their speeches by also allowing users  
[00:04:53] to choose their topics and gamifying the process. 
We keep users engaged in what they're learning.  
[00:04:57] Finally, our app is also free to use, though 
we will offer a premium version with more AI  
[00:05:02] features for the students who will use the app. 
We will provide a phonics trainer that works to  
[00:05:07] improve their reading and speaking skills, 
although they will have to spend more time  
[00:05:10] on electronics. For parents, we will provide 
a tracker for their child's progress for free,  
[00:05:14] which will require more involvement from them 
and their students learning process. For schools,  
[00:05:19] we provide a lowcost alternative to specialized 
help that teachers can manage as long as the  
[00:05:23] students are given access to the internet. We 
designed our app to support students, parents,  
[00:05:28] and schools by promoting well-being, autonomy, and 
justice. For students, learning is personalized,  
[00:05:33] accessible, and flexible, no matter who they 
are or where they're from. Parents save time  
[00:05:37] and money, support their child's learning 
at home, and stay informed with progress  
[00:05:41] tracking. Schools can shift budgets away from 
expensive tools, and better understand students  
[00:05:45] needs. Even underfunded schools can use the app 
for free. We recognize that AI can have biases,  
[00:05:50] so we will train our AI to consider 
users diverse backgrounds like speech  
[00:05:54] impediments or secondary languages based on their 
profile selections. As we look into the future,  
[00:06:01] when we build our premium app, these are the 
added features. An AI powered Mad Libs testing  
[00:06:06] to give more targeted feedback, a translators to 
support students who speak different languages,  
[00:06:11] bonus learning interactive games to be more 
engaging, and more personalized learning paths  
[00:06:15] for more personalization and engagement, and 
an improved gamified approach. These features  
[00:06:21] make learning fun and inclusive for students, 
give focused feedback to parents and teachers,  
[00:06:25] and support English learners while respecting 
their native native language. We will also  
[00:06:30] keep expanding in a personal AI model to make it 
even more inclusive to diverse backgrounds. Our  
[00:06:37] team worked together on development, design, and 
research to bring this vision to life. And special  
[00:06:41] thanks to our mentor, Tacio. This is phonics, 
smart tools for smarter readers. Any questions?
[00:06:52] Thank you so for the presentation. Um, I had 
a question about the model that you talked  
[00:06:58] about developing to account for users who have 
speech impediments or accents. Have you thought  
[00:07:04] about what kind of data you need to collect 
and how much for that model? Uh, and yeah,  
[00:07:09] could you tell me a bit more about that? Um, I can 
take that. Um, so I was thinking we'd have to do a  
[00:07:17] lot more research into this, but I think the type 
of model we'd want is you instead of inputting,  
[00:07:22] how we're doing it now is with a large 
language model where we're using a speech  
[00:07:28] recognizer component, but we don't want to go 
directly from the sound that the user puts into  
[00:07:34] text. We want to take the sound itself and 
try and detect how similar that sound is to  
[00:07:40] the to the desired sound. So if we want them 
to say the sentence, John went to the store,  
[00:07:45] John went, we have to follow the pattern of 
the sentence, but even if they have an accent,  
[00:07:50] there's still that same pattern of the vocals. 
Um, and if they have a lisp, there are certain  
[00:07:56] patterns, I expect. So we collect a lot 
of data. We collect a lot of data of how  
[00:08:01] um people with different accents, people with 
lisps, um people who speak different ways,  
[00:08:06] how all of that can be um normalized into a 
model that can detect how they're speaking.
[00:08:14] Great. Thank you. I really appreciated 
what you shared here. Uh I happen to teach  
[00:08:23] reading as a professor to people 
that want to become students. So,  
[00:08:26] I was my ears really perked up and I thought 
you all did a wonderful job. I'm just curious if  
[00:08:32] uh you all have thought about uh like different 
levels in how someone might progress from being  
[00:08:40] able to read letter sounds to being able to 
read sentences to reading paragraphs. Have  
[00:08:46] you given any thought to an approach that would 
be hierarchical? Yeah. So, as for the base app,  
[00:08:53] we do have a somewhat progressive system where if 
the user says says a word and says the syllables  
[00:08:59] correctly, they'll get a percentage accuracy 
to the word that they're trying to say. So,  
[00:09:03] if they were to get like 50% of the word syllables 
correctly, then the system would show that they  
[00:09:08] were 50% correct and they just have this way to 
go. And as they get better and better and they  
[00:09:12] get that 100% mark on like one word, we also have 
sentences, full sentences that they can move on to  
[00:09:18] to test their work on multiple different syllable 
syllables that are combined together. And as an  
[00:09:22] extension, we could add full paragraphs that the 
user would be tested on. And it would also give  
[00:09:26] that same percentage accuracy so the user has 
a sense of progression while they use the app.
[00:09:34] Um, I'd like to add on to that just a little 
bit. Um, the app currently also has a progression  
[00:09:39] system. So you pick your topics and then there are 
certain words in each of those categories. If you  
[00:09:44] pick animals, you start with dog, cat, rat, you 
move on to harder words, animal, cheetah, and then  
[00:09:50] you get to really hard words zoologologist. 
So it's you move on to harder words as you
[00:09:59] I just want to say a huge unmet need 
and it hasn't been solved and I I I  
[00:10:04] almost feel like if it's ever going to 
be solved is with a solution like this.  
[00:10:07] Just wanted to ask you how you are planning 
to connect uh your app to help students  
[00:10:15] develop reading comprehension as well as the 
love of reading which is the ultimate goal.
[00:10:26] Uh I can take this question. So uh currently 
we have a uh a feature where students can pick  
[00:10:35] their topics but in the future um we want 
to develop uh a system where they can read  
[00:10:42] those paragraphs based on the topics and so 
uh when they engage with the paragraphs it  
[00:10:47] feels like they are more learning and engaging 
rather than having just another assignment to
