[00:00:00] I see a mistake founders make again and
[00:00:01] again. I started a company because I
[00:00:03] wanted to start a company and I I wish
[00:00:04] that someone had sat us down and said
[00:00:06] guys first figure out what you want to
[00:00:08] tackle it because startups are not a
[00:00:10] straight line up there all kinds of
[00:00:12] everyone had near that moments and
[00:00:13] painful unless it's something you're
[00:00:15] really passionate about you're going to
[00:00:16] abandon it quit it
[00:00:17] >> you've had the chance to be part of
[00:00:19] seven different frankly generational
[00:00:21] companies Meta Google Block Door Dash
[00:00:24] Coinbase when you're trying to construct
[00:00:26] a good team to take on a mission in
[00:00:27] startup land that is in the AI sphere
[00:00:30] are there other things that you you need
[00:00:31] to be considering when putting together
[00:00:33] like a team for AI kind of startups that
[00:00:36] maybe perhaps wasn't the case I don't
[00:00:38] know 5 years ago
[00:00:40] >> the technology itself can lead to
[00:00:42] interesting product breakthroughs if you
[00:00:44] live and breathe the because the
[00:00:45] technologies underlying it the LLMs are
[00:00:48] changing so rapidly and I think if you
[00:00:49] just get somebody who's a good engineer
[00:00:51] but doesn't live and breathe this
[00:00:53] doesn't understand all the breakthroughs
[00:00:55] are going on as part of the founding
[00:00:56] team I think it is hard to build what is
[00:00:58] called an A&M today.
[00:01:05] >> Welcome everyone to another edition of
[00:01:07] the Minus One podcast uh where we
[00:01:10] discuss kind of the lives and the
[00:01:12] stories of some of the most interesting
[00:01:13] and accomplished people in the world. Um
[00:01:16] I'm honored today to kind of like have
[00:01:18] Gokul Rajaram on the podcast. Uh Gokul
[00:01:21] has had a legendary career kind of in
[00:01:24] Silicon Valley. Uh I'd say you'd be
[00:01:26] hardressed uh to find a product that you
[00:01:29] have not used or been touched by as a
[00:01:31] result of kind of like the work that
[00:01:32] he's done. Um Gokul, welcome to the
[00:01:35] podcast. Welcome to Miners One. We're
[00:01:37] excited to have you here.
[00:01:38] >> Adita, my friend, great to see you again
[00:01:40] and excited to be here. Thanks for
[00:01:42] having me.
[00:01:42] >> Gokul, you know I was just reading, you
[00:01:45] know, your website right before this,
[00:01:46] right? And it was one of the interesting
[00:01:48] amazing lines you kind of start off with
[00:01:50] is that you've had the chance to be part
[00:01:52] of seven different frankly generational
[00:01:54] companies right Meta Google Block Door
[00:01:57] Dash and so on Coinbase. So in some ways
[00:02:02] probably more so than most of us, you
[00:02:04] have probably been in that minus one
[00:02:06] phase more so than I would say most
[00:02:08] people because I like to think that in
[00:02:10] between each of these kind of projects,
[00:02:13] these companies, you must have had a
[00:02:15] time when you're trying to figure out is
[00:02:17] this actually something that is worth
[00:02:19] spending my time on, right? Like is this
[00:02:22] a project or a company or a founder that
[00:02:24] is worth kind of like spending time on?
[00:02:26] So how do you in some ways like what is
[00:02:29] your mental model? How do you kind of
[00:02:30] figure out what are the important things
[00:02:32] for you to focus on particularly you
[00:02:34] know now that in some ways you probably
[00:02:36] have a plethora of like projects that
[00:02:38] you could kind of pick from? So what is
[00:02:40] like walk us through your mental model
[00:02:41] for picking interesting things to work
[00:02:43] on.
[00:02:44] >> I think it's a great great point and I
[00:02:46] think a lot of folks um today especially
[00:02:48] are between things. I think always there
[00:02:51] have been people obviously between
[00:02:52] things but I feel even more so as this
[00:02:55] new wave of AI over the last two years
[00:02:57] has gotten many ambitious people
[00:02:59] thinking what next and uh essentially if
[00:03:03] you think about it I think of two things
[00:03:05] as as the most important one does the
[00:03:08] mission is the mission big enough and
[00:03:11] meaningful enough for it to matter so
[00:03:14] and is it aligned with my own personal
[00:03:16] things that I care about
[00:03:17] >> and now we can go deeper into each of
[00:03:19] And the second is if if it is a company
[00:03:22] I'm joining or if it's you know some
[00:03:24] it's a company I'm joining or it's an
[00:03:25] idea who is it I'm doing it with is it
[00:03:27] is the team or the person I'm going to
[00:03:29] be working with or for are they
[00:03:31] inspirational are they complimentary is
[00:03:34] it someone I would basically enjoy
[00:03:36] spending time with and is it the right
[00:03:38] person that together we can accomplish
[00:03:40] great things and and accomplish the
[00:03:42] mission so it's mission and people I
[00:03:45] think mission is number one in some ways
[00:03:47] because I feel once you are aligned on
[00:03:49] the mission and I think I made the
[00:03:51] biggest mistake in some ways. Uh which
[00:03:54] proved to be good in retrospect because
[00:03:56] I joined Meta uh Facebook back then when
[00:03:59] I started my company Chiliabs because I
[00:04:01] think uh and this I see a mistake this
[00:04:04] founders make again and again. I started
[00:04:06] a company because I wanted to start a
[00:04:07] company. I was at Google. I saw a lot of
[00:04:09] people leaving to start companies and I
[00:04:11] said you know it's something I want to
[00:04:12] do and my brother had just gotten his
[00:04:14] green card and he was a very good
[00:04:16] engineer and I was like you know what
[00:04:17] we've never worked together. let's work
[00:04:18] together. I can be the product guy. I
[00:04:19] can be the engineer. Let's start a
[00:04:20] company. So, we started a company for
[00:04:22] the sake of starting a company. And what
[00:04:24] is crazy is that Silicon Valley enabled
[00:04:26] it. We were able to get money from
[00:04:28] Facebook's investors. Even though we're
[00:04:29] not Facebook, we got Excel, Greylock,
[00:04:31] Mark Anderson, and Reed Hoffman, all
[00:04:32] these guys put money into us without
[00:04:34] even knowing what the hell our idea was,
[00:04:35] what problem we were solving, what we
[00:04:37] were targeting. And it was really bad in
[00:04:39] some ways because they were just
[00:04:41] enabling us. And I I wish that someone
[00:04:43] had sat us down and said, "Guys, first
[00:04:45] figure out what you want to tackle." And
[00:04:47] I think it it it basically without
[00:04:49] having a notch problem um that you go
[00:04:52] after uh you basically we we kind of
[00:04:55] were like the you know tree in the wind
[00:04:57] when the wind blew this way we go this
[00:04:58] way and then this way and so we almost
[00:05:01] we read something and say let's go
[00:05:02] pursue this and then we pursue this and
[00:05:04] that and it was it was painful and we
[00:05:06] ultimately glombmed on to something but
[00:05:08] I wouldn't say it was our passion it was
[00:05:09] more almost necessity we had to do it
[00:05:12] and that's not a way to build a great
[00:05:13] company. So, I always I've had so many
[00:05:15] people work for me with me who are like,
[00:05:17] "Hey, I'm my buddy and I are going to
[00:05:19] start a company together."
[00:05:21] Is that what you're going to tell me?
[00:05:22] It's your buddy and you're going to
[00:05:23] start a company. Is that what you want
[00:05:25] to start a company because it's your
[00:05:26] buddy?
[00:05:27] >> Don't do this. And I'm telling you again
[00:05:28] and again, I see this people make this
[00:05:30] mistake. So,
[00:05:31] >> what is your problem which is meaningful
[00:05:33] enough and meaty enough that you want to
[00:05:34] tackle that for the next 10 years? Yeah.
[00:05:36] >> It can be a northstar for you to pursue
[00:05:39] that you're willing because as you know,
[00:05:41] startups are not a straight line up.
[00:05:42] There's all kinds of things.
[00:05:44] >> Everyone had near-death moments and
[00:05:46] painful.
[00:05:48] >> Unless it's something you're really
[00:05:49] passionate about, you're going to
[00:05:49] abandon it. Quit it.
[00:05:51] >> Yeah.
[00:05:51] >> I think the only lucky thing was my
[00:05:52] brother and I were brothers. So, we
[00:05:54] never quit.
[00:05:55] >> Yes. Exactly.
[00:05:56] >> Quit that. So, we could have just one of
[00:05:57] us probably would have walked away at
[00:05:58] some point. It was so painful also in
[00:06:00] the middle of the global financial
[00:06:01] crisis in 2008 2010.
[00:06:03] >> So, I think it's mission and people.
[00:06:05] Mission and people.
[00:06:06] >> That's actually a great crisp
[00:06:07] articulation and I'll get into a bunch
[00:06:09] of that. But first, Gokul, I want to
[00:06:11] give you credit. I think Chai Labs is
[00:06:13] actually a great name. Like it is very
[00:06:16] evocative like at least perhaps because
[00:06:19] I'm Indian. I just like the idea of kind
[00:06:21] of like sitting thinking having a chai
[00:06:24] kind of like figuring out what to work
[00:06:25] on. So like it's just actually a great
[00:06:27] name. So first of all good credit for
[00:06:29] names. You know
[00:06:29] >> there's at least one thing we built
[00:06:31] which is
[00:06:33] >> it's a great name. Um but you know I I
[00:06:36] think Google obviously I I think you
[00:06:38] know at SPC we strongly subscribe to
[00:06:42] kind of this idea that uh startups are a
[00:06:44] I mean we'll get back to this we think
[00:06:46] startups are a marathon you know it's a
[00:06:48] marathon that you're running at a sprint
[00:06:50] often which is kind of like exactly so
[00:06:52] it's kind of this weird combination
[00:06:54] where you are you have to sprint for a
[00:06:56] very long time but it is definitely a
[00:06:57] marathon right um and so our take is
[00:07:01] that man like if you're going to be
[00:07:03] running for a very long time it's okay
[00:07:05] to take 6 n months to figure out what is
[00:07:07] a race worth running right like you know
[00:07:10] put another way you know if if you're so
[00:07:12] focused on scaling the mountain what
[00:07:14] happens if after 3 years you figure out
[00:07:16] it's a wrong mountain or it's a small
[00:07:18] mountain it turns out to be a hill you
[00:07:19] know and great mountaineers often spend
[00:07:22] more time planning the expedition than
[00:07:24] they do actually kind of like climbing
[00:07:26] the damn thing so you're speaking you're
[00:07:28] definitely I think very resonant with
[00:07:30] our worldview you know we've both been
[00:07:32] in Silicon Valley for a long time you
[00:07:34] know I've been in Silicon Valley for 20
[00:07:36] years and you've kind of been around for
[00:07:37] almost 25 30 years as well and one of
[00:07:39] the weird things to me is that Kok like
[00:07:41] compared to even a decade ago there is
[00:07:44] an order of magnitude more venture
[00:07:46] capital in the system today if not more
[00:07:48] right uh and yet if you ask me are there
[00:07:50] like 10x more amazing strong big ideas
[00:07:53] being tackled I'm like I'm not sure
[00:07:55] right like it's weird where like the
[00:07:57] rate of like ambition is not increasing
[00:07:59] at the same rate of like venture capital
[00:08:01] and I think a lot of it is because there
[00:08:04] is this big amount of impatience in
[00:08:07] starting a company where it's very hard
[00:08:09] to sit in the muck sit in kind of the
[00:08:12] discomfort of like you know I don't know
[00:08:14] I'm not 100% sure I don't have a great
[00:08:17] kind of insight yet I don't have a
[00:08:18] mission that I'm passionate about yet
[00:08:20] right so I guess you know from your
[00:08:22] perspective here's maybe the precise
[00:08:24] question I actually am curious to get
[00:08:26] your answer do you think it is possible
[00:08:29] to almost first principles your way into
[00:08:31] a great mission or Is that some amount
[00:08:33] of like
[00:08:35] serendipity, intuition, kind of creative
[00:08:38] kind of like the creative stroke that
[00:08:40] kind of comes to you? Can you almost
[00:08:42] will your way into a good mission? I'm
[00:08:44] curious.
[00:08:45] >> You sometimes can, but ultimately it
[00:08:48] comes from a personal connection to it.
[00:08:50] I think uh
[00:08:51] >> I feel if you look at and many times if
[00:08:53] you look at these missions, right, they
[00:08:54] evolve organically, but it has to be
[00:08:56] something you're passionate about. And I
[00:08:59] think if you if you start a company just
[00:09:01] to start a company, I think that's a
[00:09:03] very mercenary way. And I feel that's
[00:09:05] not if you look at Zuck, right? Great
[00:09:07] example. He didn't start a company. He
[00:09:09] first wanted to just solve a problem for
[00:09:10] himself and that became a company. Larry
[00:09:13] and Sergey, they just wanted to build a
[00:09:14] search engine and then it became a
[00:09:16] company. So that's a crazy thing. Most
[00:09:17] of the companies have been involved with
[00:09:18] Door Dash. The guys just did a research
[00:09:20] project or a project at school at
[00:09:22] Stanford. The same at Jack and Jim. Jim
[00:09:25] was at Square. Jim was rejected for
[00:09:26] credit card processing and they said
[00:09:28] this is and we're going to
[00:09:29] solve this problem and it became a
[00:09:31] company. So solving I think trying to
[00:09:33] solve problems and then it morphing into
[00:09:35] a company is a great way because then
[00:09:37] versus like saying well I've read in
[00:09:39] tech crunch that this market is this big
[00:09:40] and I'm going to solve it and that's
[00:09:42] there's no personal connection no
[00:09:44] authenticity in the story. I feel there
[00:09:46] has to be an authentic thing because if
[00:09:48] you don't truly feel it you're going to
[00:09:49] always abandon ship when things get
[00:09:52] tough and things get painful.
[00:09:53] >> Yeah it's interesting. You know, often
[00:09:55] times when people are in the idea maze,
[00:09:57] what I keep on coming back to telling
[00:09:58] them is that like you kind of go back
[00:10:00] and figure out something that you're
[00:10:02] actually passionate about working on
[00:10:04] solving. What problems have you faced?
[00:10:06] And this is why like you know it's it's
[00:10:08] tricky because you often have to go
[00:10:10] searching back like you know through
[00:10:11] either your work history or through your
[00:10:13] personal history like what is act and I
[00:10:15] think that the thing that perhaps should
[00:10:17] give people hope I suspect everybody has
[00:10:20] one of those ideas in them you know like
[00:10:22] and you can get stuck. It's not easy to
[00:10:24] draw it out but I think if you are kind
[00:10:26] of smart and creative you have it in
[00:10:28] you. Some people it might be more buried
[00:10:30] than other people. Some people are more
[00:10:31] natural I think at being generative and
[00:10:33] being creative.
[00:10:35] >> Uh but I do think that those that kind
[00:10:38] of well of creativity exists in a lot of
[00:10:40] people you know uh
[00:10:42] >> one of the best ways I feel to force
[00:10:43] people to do this is if anyone comes to
[00:10:45] me with a B2B idea where at square one
[00:10:48] of the biggest challenges we had unlike
[00:10:49] Door Dash, Facebook and Google was those
[00:10:52] are consumer companies. So as consumers
[00:10:53] you could live the problem.
[00:10:54] >> You could live the problem.
[00:10:55] >> You're not a merchant. So we would force
[00:10:57] people to go and spend one week working
[00:11:00] the counter of a merchant. And it was
[00:11:02] pretty cool. And so I think increasingly
[00:11:04] I tell uh okay you want to solve a the
[00:11:07] problem for an HWAC company. I want you
[00:11:09] to go and work for two weeks at a HWAC
[00:11:11] company and be the IT consultant there.
[00:11:13] If you can't, how the hell are you going
[00:11:14] to sell anything? Go and find a job and
[00:11:16] be the IT consultant. Go native. go
[00:11:18] undercover and basically then truly
[00:11:21] experience the pain and then come back
[00:11:22] to me and tell me what the pain points
[00:11:23] are. Don't just say because you read
[00:11:25] this, you interviewed. I want you to
[00:11:26] spend time in the shop on their side and
[00:11:29] then experience the problem.
[00:11:30] >> Let me ask you a spicy question. I'm
[00:11:32] actually very curious to get your take
[00:11:33] on this. Perhaps it's because I'm bad at
[00:11:36] doing this. I have never believed that
[00:11:38] talking to users is that interesting. I
[00:11:41] would much rather tell like get people
[00:11:43] to react to ideas and solutions because
[00:11:46] I'm just if you ask most pe because it's
[00:11:48] not the user's job to tell me like what
[00:11:50] great ideas are that's my job like as a
[00:11:52] builder right so exactly
[00:11:54] >> like I'm curious does that resonate with
[00:11:56] you like when people say to do user
[00:11:58] research I'm always like to what end you
[00:12:00] know
[00:12:01] >> yeah I I think there is a subtle thing
[00:12:02] here my take is you interview people and
[00:12:05] there's a way of interviewing them to
[00:12:07] uncover problems you never interview
[00:12:09] them to uncover solutions
[00:12:11] As you know if you ask people for
[00:12:12] solution they will ask you they will
[00:12:14] keep asking faster horses and so on
[00:12:16] horse. So and the way to interview them
[00:12:18] to uncor problems is to ask them to tell
[00:12:21] stories. So in other words for example
[00:12:23] if I were to say you know why did you
[00:12:26] choose Netflix yesterday night to watch
[00:12:27] a movie. You might be hardressed to kind
[00:12:29] of tell me exactly why or why do you
[00:12:31] choose Netflix you know but if I say
[00:12:33] just tell me the last time you choose a
[00:12:35] movie. Tell me about the process you
[00:12:36] went through. Tell me the story. Well,
[00:12:38] you know, we were sitting around, the
[00:12:39] kids wanted to watch something. I opened
[00:12:41] the TV. There's nothing on Xfinity or
[00:12:43] YouTube TV, but I I like, you know, so
[00:12:45] you basically go through the whole
[00:12:46] journey and then you're like, okay, so
[00:12:48] these are the this is the journey. So
[00:12:50] the journey is what then it it talks
[00:12:52] about the decision point. It talks about
[00:12:53] the why. And so I I like hearing the
[00:12:56] stories of what caused them to take
[00:12:58] aition and the story is a way to
[00:12:59] interview. So I used tried to use
[00:13:01] storytelling. Everyone likes to tell
[00:13:03] stories of what they did something. the
[00:13:05] richer the better and the stories have a
[00:13:06] lot of nuggets that help you uncover
[00:13:08] what pain they were trying to solve and
[00:13:10] what you can do to make
[00:13:11] >> actually really good. I mean, I actually
[00:13:12] think that even for my own personal kind
[00:13:14] of cannon of knowledge, I'm actually
[00:13:16] going to stop calling it user research
[00:13:18] and I'm just like call it user
[00:13:19] storytelling. Like I just want to hear
[00:13:21] stories about users lives, right? And
[00:13:24] about users lives.
[00:13:26] >> Yeah. And like make it like mundane. So
[00:13:28] the mundane can be fascinating if you're
[00:13:30] just like actually to your point dude
[00:13:32] like you had three hours like as a young
[00:13:34] parent who has three hours to watch
[00:13:35] something. How did you like what did you
[00:13:37] do? Tell me everything.
[00:13:38] >> Exactly. You know
[00:13:39] >> exactly tell me the context. What were
[00:13:41] you doing? Where were you sitting
[00:13:41] around? How did you guys even decide to
[00:13:43] watch it watch a movie versus doing
[00:13:44] something else. Exactly. So let's go to
[00:13:46] that you know that discussion and so you
[00:13:48] just unear a lot of so you just get them
[00:13:50] to describe and then obviously
[00:13:52] thankfully now with pendants limitless
[00:13:53] and so on you can record a lot so you
[00:13:55] don't have to like earlier I would be
[00:13:57] sitting and taking notes seriously now
[00:13:58] you can just record in granola or
[00:14:00] something like that and and then you can
[00:14:02] ex you know extract stuff from it.
[00:14:03] >> That's amazing. But you're right,
[00:14:04] solutions have to come from your own
[00:14:06] intuition, but the problems can be
[00:14:08] surfaced through these rich stories
[00:14:10] hopefully.
[00:14:11] >> Yeah. It's one of the weird dichotoies
[00:14:13] of like starting a company where I tell
[00:14:15] people to your point the harder you are
[00:14:17] trying to start a company, the least
[00:14:20] probably you're going to be straight
[00:14:21] line successful. So in some ways you
[00:14:23] almost have to be a little bit light
[00:14:25] about it. You can't force it. you kind
[00:14:27] of have to you kind of have to let go to
[00:14:29] the process of serendipity you know like
[00:14:32] this is why I think at SBC when people
[00:14:34] come in and you know if they've had a
[00:14:36] really stressful kind of like job at a
[00:14:39] startup or like they were doing some you
[00:14:40] know something crazy and then people ask
[00:14:42] me like oh this really fun person you
[00:14:44] this really talented person joined SPC
[00:14:46] what are they working on I'm like
[00:14:48] they're going to take two months to kind
[00:14:49] of just like unwind and it's
[00:14:51] >> I think it's a great philosophy man
[00:14:52] because I mean I I admire some of these
[00:14:54] accelerators no but but I do think they
[00:14:57] quickly get you to pivot and they you
[00:14:59] have a certain amount of eight weeks to
[00:15:00] come up with an idea of pivoting and
[00:15:02] that's hard that's hard
[00:15:04] >> and like my take is that like in the
[00:15:06] beginning and I think the part that's
[00:15:08] tricky is that we don't know how to
[00:15:10] appreciate the fact that when your brain
[00:15:12] is doing being truly creative it is
[00:15:14] making a lot of like interesting
[00:15:16] connectivity but your brain also just
[00:15:18] takes a little bit of time because the
[00:15:19] day you you know when I left Facebook
[00:15:21] for the next two weeks I was still
[00:15:23] thinking about Facebook stuff or Dropbox
[00:15:25] stuff when I left Dropbox Right. So, um
[00:15:28] it's interesting. So, you almost have to
[00:15:30] let go and be a little bit rudderless,
[00:15:33] you have to be less like straight line
[00:15:35] directed, which is hard for us in
[00:15:36] Silicon Valley because we want to be in
[00:15:38] control, you know, like this is the key.
[00:15:39] >> That's why so many good ideas for people
[00:15:40] come in the shower or when they're out
[00:15:42] in nature or so on because you're not
[00:15:44] connected with something. Your mind is
[00:15:46] free and it's free to make these
[00:15:47] connections that would normally not
[00:15:49] happen because you're in a structured
[00:15:50] environment.
[00:15:50] >> Yeah. It's interesting, you know, to
[00:15:52] your point, when you go talk to a lot of
[00:15:53] these founders, whether it be Larry and
[00:15:55] Sergey, whether it be Mark, whether it
[00:15:57] be um obviously uh Jack at kind of
[00:16:00] Square or Tony at Door Dash, you can
[00:16:03] boil I mean there's obviously a lot of
[00:16:05] mythology that gets created over time,
[00:16:07] but there is often a moment where you
[00:16:09] can boil it down to like some moment of
[00:16:11] frustration and serendipity and then
[00:16:13] intense activity following that moment
[00:16:16] of like creation, right? And then after
[00:16:18] that like there's a lot more company
[00:16:20] building and I find that fascinating
[00:16:22] because um at its root that is what
[00:16:25] creation is where there's that spark of
[00:16:28] like kind of in some ways creativity and
[00:16:29] innovation.
[00:16:30] >> I think one of the most interesting
[00:16:31] conversation I've ever had was Dylan
[00:16:33] Field at Figma. Oh god.
[00:16:34] >> I met Dylan in 2012. In fact I was at
[00:16:37] Facebook. He came to have lunch with me
[00:16:38] at Facebook and the guy I could just see
[00:16:41] he had an obsession at design. He had
[00:16:43] dropped out of of Dartmouth if I
[00:16:45] remember or brown or somewhere and he
[00:16:46] was living at home
[00:16:47] >> either a brown he was brown yeah
[00:16:49] >> he was a brown and he he basically and I
[00:16:52] had used Photoshop at my startup and it
[00:16:54] was a it was really crappy I couldn't
[00:16:56] even download it properly use it on my
[00:16:57] IBM laptop back then and Dylan said I
[00:16:59] have Photoshop I have a better thing
[00:17:01] than Photoshop running on my browser I'm
[00:17:02] like no way I don't believe this and
[00:17:04] then he showed showed it to me and it
[00:17:06] was super fast and it was it actually
[00:17:08] worked I played around with it and I
[00:17:10] could you could just see the subtle
[00:17:11] touches he around design. He had no
[00:17:14] there was no sharing capability,
[00:17:15] nothing. It was simply a single user
[00:17:17] mode, but it was Photoshop in the
[00:17:18] browser. And you could see it was better
[00:17:20] than Photoshop in many ways, not not
[00:17:22] fully baked in other ways. And that
[00:17:24] passion for of design passion for him
[00:17:26] coupled with the fact that the guy I
[00:17:28] think he had one other person on it was
[00:17:30] able to build this
[00:17:31] >> Evan just Yeah. Evan Exactly. and and
[00:17:34] just that you know that just instantly
[00:17:36] that was one of the meetings where
[00:17:37] >> you know immediately you know
[00:17:39] immediately like this person you know
[00:17:40] it's I mean one second on Photoshop
[00:17:43] honestly I bet this is Photoshop is one
[00:17:45] of those pieces of software that 98% of
[00:17:47] people who have heard of Photoshop have
[00:17:50] never figured out how to use it because
[00:17:52] like the complexity of the layers all of
[00:17:54] the things you're just like most and I'm
[00:17:55] a software engineer and I have never
[00:17:57] really used use Photoshop right it's too
[00:17:59] complex but Figma it's in the browser
[00:18:02] nothing to install all within 30 seconds
[00:18:04] you'll figure it out right and that's
[00:18:06] incredible
[00:18:07] >> think of it it came from his passion
[00:18:08] over years
[00:18:10] >> or his passion for design led him to
[00:18:11] this it's almost a natural thing you can
[00:18:13] extrapolate young Dylan
[00:18:15] >> to yes that's the kind of company he
[00:18:16] would start because of
[00:18:18] >> you know so
[00:18:19] >> and Dylan is I mean he is truly
[00:18:20] passionate about design as a craft like
[00:18:22] he just believes deeply in it um and you
[00:18:26] know to your one more thing that you
[00:18:28] said which is that the you know kind of
[00:18:29] the the and this is it's hard to kind
[00:18:33] give people this advice about something,
[00:18:35] but the best founders have insane
[00:18:37] fractal knowledge and obsession about
[00:18:40] what they're working on. It's not
[00:18:42] because they just want that's the right
[00:18:44] way to do a company. It's because
[00:18:45] they're genuinely deeply curious.
[00:18:47] >> You're absolutely right. In fact, the
[00:18:48] Collison, I believe, went and got a book
[00:18:50] on payments from the 1950s. Yeah.
[00:18:52] >> And looked at complete read the entire
[00:18:54] history of the payment industry, why it
[00:18:56] worked, interviewed every person they
[00:18:58] could find. Yeah. And this is the thing
[00:18:59] your point about the idea m I ask all
[00:19:01] kinds of random questions to understand
[00:19:03] why did you approach this because
[00:19:05] they've taken most founders have a
[00:19:07] specific approach solving the problem I
[00:19:08] ask them why couldn't you take this
[00:19:10] other approach random approach and I
[00:19:11] want to understand how deeply steeped
[00:19:14] are they in the history of this problem
[00:19:17] >> why haven't they they're so excited
[00:19:18] about this problem why haven't they
[00:19:19] >> why haven't they gone super deep
[00:19:21] >> exactly super deep why is this approach
[00:19:23] not so they have a very well-reasoned
[00:19:24] answer for how they navigate the IDMAS
[00:19:26] to get to this way this wedge tackled
[00:19:29] the problem first was this other wedge.
[00:19:30] And you're right, it shows in the
[00:19:32] passion. It shows in the understanding
[00:19:33] the history of the industry of the
[00:19:35] problem of the pioneers. This problem, I
[00:19:37] promise you, someone would have tackled
[00:19:39] it in some way, shape, or form before.
[00:19:41] >> Yeah.
[00:19:41] >> None of these companies, search was not
[00:19:43] the first one. Facebook was not the
[00:19:44] first one. Square was not the first not
[00:19:46] the first engine. They all been tackled.
[00:19:48] Why is this better? What is the problem
[00:19:50] with future? If you can't tell that,
[00:19:51] hang on. You don't know what the history
[00:19:53] of what you're doing is
[00:19:54] >> you know that also is a interesting
[00:19:56] Yeah. And it's so and perhaps the maybe
[00:19:59] the way to frame this into advice for
[00:20:01] founders is that if you are not that
[00:20:04] obsessive about something, you just
[00:20:06] might not care enough about this might
[00:20:08] not be your mission. Like if you don't
[00:20:10] >> this might not be your mission. If
[00:20:12] you're not that passionate like listen,
[00:20:14] you're either the kind of person who's
[00:20:15] really into HVAC or you're not. Okay?
[00:20:18] Like if you're into HVAC, you'll
[00:20:19] probably figure out why heating and
[00:20:21] cooling is such a big way for expanding
[00:20:23] frankly like geographic colonization of
[00:20:25] the world and living in different
[00:20:26] places. It's been a big hu boost to
[00:20:28] human productivity. Like it's actually
[00:20:30] like a really deployed piece of
[00:20:32] technology and it's really important to
[00:20:34] do it cost efficiently. There's a ton of
[00:20:36] money that goes into it. But if you're
[00:20:38] not a nerd about it, then maybe you just
[00:20:40] don't care. And that's okay. Go find
[00:20:41] something that you actually want to be
[00:20:43] >> obsessed with living and breathing
[00:20:44] within the Hack community. If you really
[00:20:46] are building a company, I mean the
[00:20:47] service titan guys came from a family I
[00:20:49] believe exactly
[00:20:50] >> attract people right I mean their
[00:20:51] families did they lived and breathed it
[00:20:53] for many years before they were doing
[00:20:54] >> and they're truly if you talk to Ara and
[00:20:56] you I mean I've kind of got the chance
[00:20:59] to kind of like I would say help them
[00:21:00] with a bunch of CTO related stuff over
[00:21:02] the years I mean whenever he asks me a
[00:21:06] question about how to build the
[00:21:07] engineering organization it is he's very
[00:21:10] honest like listen I am building HWAC
[00:21:12] related kind of like you know end toend
[00:21:14] software I'm And so I don't want a
[00:21:17] general purpose great CTO. I want a CTO
[00:21:19] who's great for this. I'm like that's
[00:21:20] well framed. Very few like not every CTO
[00:21:22] is going to love this, right? But when
[00:21:24] they do they should be super obsessive
[00:21:26] about it. So perhaps to switch gears a
[00:21:28] second here.
[00:21:30] >> Do you think that there's enough of
[00:21:33] you've obviously you know you're
[00:21:35] familiar with the ecosystem in India as
[00:21:37] well, right? Um and so one of the things
[00:21:40] we started SPC in Bangalore uh about 12
[00:21:43] months ago and it's been awesome.
[00:21:45] >> I was in Bangalore recently and it's
[00:21:46] definitely a buzz around it. Okay.
[00:21:48] >> I appreciate you saying that. Um and I
[00:21:50] have just been blown away by the quality
[00:21:52] of founders just like the raw talent in
[00:21:54] India. And I think the big one of the
[00:21:56] questions that I'm trying to figure out
[00:21:58] is like how do we more fully embrace
[00:22:01] this idea of illeible kind of like early
[00:22:04] like somewhat weird ideas go deep right?
[00:22:07] there might be non like and don't just
[00:22:09] focus on the operationally heavy
[00:22:11] businesses also go for places where
[00:22:12] there's true technology and product
[00:22:14] alpha right so I guess perhaps other
[00:22:17] pieces of advice you would give to the
[00:22:19] ecosystem in India in particular on how
[00:22:21] to create these seinal companies uh that
[00:22:25] I think India definitely has raw talent
[00:22:27] for but today I think sometimes we you
[00:22:29] know everybody's talking about like
[00:22:30] where the AI companies out of India and
[00:22:32] so on right so I'm curious what advice
[00:22:34] would you give to the ecosystem in India
[00:22:36] >> I think the number One thing is being
[00:22:38] patient. I think Indian society in
[00:22:39] general including parents which are a
[00:22:41] big part of the ecosystem. There is a
[00:22:43] lot of focus on role models. So I think
[00:22:46] the more every role model flipkart role
[00:22:49] model the bunels you know basically led
[00:22:51] to a million e-commerce startups and
[00:22:54] that became legitimized. Similarly you
[00:22:56] know Uber or Ola or oh sorry Ola Oo etc.
[00:22:59] they created another ecosystem. So I
[00:23:01] think financial services grow and and
[00:23:03] zeroda they create another set of so I
[00:23:05] think if you look at the top Indian
[00:23:07] companies they're either financial
[00:23:08] services or e-commerce it's because the
[00:23:10] pioneering companies that inspired them
[00:23:12] so I think we need one or two winners in
[00:23:15] deep tech out of India which are which
[00:23:17] are basically so I think we need
[00:23:19] patience there are some good ones there
[00:23:20] are some space tech ones there are some
[00:23:22] other ones we need a couple of them to
[00:23:24] win and the good news is economic times
[00:23:26] and other newspapers and and media
[00:23:28] broadly not just economic times but the
[00:23:29] internet does a good job of making these
[00:23:32] heroes broadly accessible and there's
[00:23:34] enough people they just need role models
[00:23:36] I think in general Indian youth it's
[00:23:38] because I think various societal
[00:23:40] pressures but you need role models to
[00:23:42] show it's possible
[00:23:43] >> and then there is going to be
[00:23:45] >> that's a good way of articulating it
[00:23:47] >> even Arvin from perplexity he's a role
[00:23:49] model you could argue that obviously
[00:23:51] he's done it in Silicon Valley but
[00:23:52] having go to India and spend more time
[00:23:54] in India people do think of him as a
[00:23:55] role model I've heard many times people
[00:23:57] mentioned so many folks like you I mean
[00:23:59] you know the more you go and more we
[00:24:01] spend time in India Arvin you there's
[00:24:03] more and more Indian founders of global
[00:24:05] companies founders of global companies
[00:24:06] out of the US they were not I mean there
[00:24:08] were not as many earlier I think there
[00:24:10] were more B2B kind of companies but now
[00:24:12] they are founders of consumerish
[00:24:13] companies consumer companies that are
[00:24:15] used globally that's a rarity and I
[00:24:17] think the more we can say that global
[00:24:19] companies can be founded by people who
[00:24:20] have similar backgrounds to you you know
[00:24:22] you you have no and talent is there
[00:24:24] talent
[00:24:25] >> yeah talent is there this is a good way
[00:24:26] of articulating it because you're right
[00:24:28] because the the positive way of stating
[00:24:29] this would actually I mean sorry the one
[00:24:31] way interpretation is when you can point
[00:24:34] the talent towards like a good kind of
[00:24:36] kind of in some ways um a good persona
[00:24:40] to kind of get inspired by then you know
[00:24:42] you can actually we can make that happen
[00:24:43] we can enable that right and you're
[00:24:45] right like in particular some of the
[00:24:47] deeper tech stuff in our portfolio in
[00:24:49] India around drones and kind of space
[00:24:51] and kind of like flight essentially uh
[00:24:54] they're very interesting companies and
[00:24:55] we have one in particular that I'm very
[00:24:56] excited about his started by a guy
[00:24:58] called Shri Pura
[00:24:59] And so I think that the I mean he's kind
[00:25:02] of building essentially like high
[00:25:04] alitude essentially drones that can
[00:25:07] carry like 200 kg like payloads or
[00:25:09] something right and this is if done well
[00:25:11] this could actually be something that is
[00:25:12] obviously very relevant in India but
[00:25:14] globally and this is just a young team
[00:25:16] you know kind of out out of IIT I think
[00:25:18] Madras like 22 year olds who can kind of
[00:25:20] pull this off. So like that's kind of
[00:25:22] the role model, right? Which is this
[00:25:23] true technology, this true daring, this
[00:25:25] true ambition. Um very
[00:25:28] >> a good mentor. Connect him. I think
[00:25:30] connect them with these promising
[00:25:31] people. Connect them with good mentors.
[00:25:33] Yes.
[00:25:33] >> Who who they can look up to, aspire to.
[00:25:35] Every every one of these people should
[00:25:36] get a mentor that they can be coached
[00:25:38] by. I always say one of the things that
[00:25:40] every founder I mean Tony was excellent
[00:25:42] at. I don't know about Zuck. I'm sure
[00:25:43] Zuck Zuck Peter was his mentor, right? I
[00:25:45] mean Tony.
[00:25:46] >> Yeah.
[00:25:46] >> You know always like who's the mentor? I
[00:25:48] mean he had so many offers to join
[00:25:50] boards but he took the meta offer I
[00:25:52] think because he saw that he can learn a
[00:25:54] lot of having Zuck build a master
[00:25:56] >> I mean like Mark has always Zuck has
[00:25:58] always built an incredible board right
[00:25:59] like between like you know Mark and
[00:26:01] recent has been on the board for gosh
[00:26:03] like 18 years or something
[00:26:04] >> that's right
[00:26:07] Mark and yeah Reed Hastings back in the
[00:26:09] day and even today like you know his
[00:26:12] board is a little bit I would say um
[00:26:15] uh you know his board is definitely
[00:26:17] somewhat unique in in terms of like the
[00:26:18] set, but he's clearly bringing people
[00:26:20] onto the board that he wants to learn
[00:26:21] from whe like Tony from Door Dash,
[00:26:23] right? Or Patrick now, right? And I, you
[00:26:26] know, I've seen Zuck over the years when
[00:26:27] Zuck gets into learning mode, as you
[00:26:29] know, he kind of gets locked in. He gets
[00:26:32] locked in.
[00:26:33] >> And I, you know, I always tell people
[00:26:34] that the I mean, I've Mark is obviously
[00:26:37] a dear friend. I've known him for a long
[00:26:38] time, but what's incredible about him is
[00:26:41] that he learns faster than most people,
[00:26:44] you know? So it's not just that his
[00:26:45] clock speed is like already very high is
[00:26:48] that his desire to kind of get better is
[00:26:50] also very high and he he just it's like
[00:26:53] a sponge. He will just kind of like
[00:26:54] start peppering you with questions
[00:26:55] examining his own beliefs. Uh it's
[00:26:57] remarkable. Um
[00:27:00] coming back of the learning many many
[00:27:03] successful entrepreneurs I think this
[00:27:04] might be one thing in India you're
[00:27:06] judged on how well you pass or do well
[00:27:07] in exams but the reality is you need to
[00:27:10] fail and and learning involves having a
[00:27:12] beginner's mindset acknowledging that
[00:27:14] you don't know anything and humility and
[00:27:15] that's the thing I think you you he's
[00:27:17] perfectly fine saying I don't know
[00:27:19] something and ads for example when I
[00:27:20] joined he didn't know much about ads but
[00:27:23] my god he was just his by the end some
[00:27:26] of the best ideas in the ads team came
[00:27:27] from Zuck because he understood what ads
[00:27:30] was all about.
[00:27:31] >> You know, it's funny you say this
[00:27:32] because I always tell people life is so
[00:27:34] much simpler when you have a beginner's
[00:27:35] mind. You don't have to be smart about
[00:27:37] most things. You can kind of be like,
[00:27:39] listen, I'm here to learn. It is so
[00:27:41] exhausting when you have to pretend to
[00:27:43] be an expert at everything, you know?
[00:27:45] And I think that like this is one of the
[00:27:46] parts that I love about well Silicon
[00:27:48] Valley, but in general about our
[00:27:49] culture, which is that it's okay to kind
[00:27:51] of admit you don't know something. Like
[00:27:53] it's it's actually much easier to be
[00:27:55] like this is what I know. this is the
[00:27:57] extent of what I know and pre I'm here
[00:27:59] to learn you know and I think we kind of
[00:28:00] take
[00:28:01] >> you are very successful so I think I've
[00:28:02] seen that the more successful you are
[00:28:04] the more comfortable you are interesting
[00:28:06] you don't you don't really owe anything
[00:28:07] to anyone you're not in an organization
[00:28:09] structure that's true if you're coming
[00:28:11] up and you're striving as a product
[00:28:13] leader you know that that's a challenge
[00:28:15] I think within an organization
[00:28:16] >> culture well said because I judge the
[00:28:19] people who work with me sometimes you're
[00:28:21] right like because I'm like how do you
[00:28:22] not know this simple thing you know
[00:28:24] you're right no you're right I I fair
[00:28:26] call out. Fair call out because there is
[00:28:28] a method like because Yeah. No, you're
[00:28:31] totally right and I appreciate kind of
[00:28:33] the more successful you get, the easier
[00:28:35] it is to not give a And I think
[00:28:37] when you're when you're
[00:28:39] >> Exactly. NGF. Exactly.
[00:28:42] >> Um interesting. Uh let me switch gears
[00:28:46] to AI. Okay. because I think we're
[00:28:48] living in super interesting weird times
[00:28:50] where not just the nature of what we
[00:28:53] build but also how we build it all seems
[00:28:56] to be shifting. So let me come back to
[00:28:58] your mission and people kind of um
[00:29:00] framing.
[00:29:02] Let's talk about the people part of it
[00:29:04] for a second. Maybe the team part when
[00:29:06] you're trying to construct a good team
[00:29:07] to take on a mission in startup land
[00:29:09] that is in the AI sphere. There's a lot
[00:29:11] of things that you want to make sure you
[00:29:12] know there's values alignment obviously
[00:29:15] both sets of people are aligned on how
[00:29:16] hard they want to work like the modality
[00:29:19] of working and I think hope but are
[00:29:21] there other things that you need to be
[00:29:23] considering when putting together like a
[00:29:25] team for AI kind of startups that maybe
[00:29:28] perhaps wasn't the case I don't know 5
[00:29:30] years ago. I think one of the most
[00:29:32] interesting things in AI I feel the
[00:29:34] technology itself can lead to
[00:29:37] interesting product breakthroughs if you
[00:29:39] live and breathe the because the
[00:29:41] technologies underlying it the LLMs are
[00:29:43] changing so rapidly and coming up with
[00:29:45] like computer use was not a thing till
[00:29:47] one year ago and it's become a huge part
[00:29:49] of many things similarly if you look at
[00:29:51] multimmodal stuff vision voice um and
[00:29:54] and and and some of the other things I
[00:29:56] think image processing and so on they've
[00:29:58] become much more advanced document
[00:30:00] processing etc. So I think you need
[00:30:02] truly someone who lives and breathes it
[00:30:04] and I think if you just get somebody
[00:30:06] who's a good engineer but doesn't live
[00:30:08] and breathe this doesn't understand all
[00:30:10] the breakthroughs are going on as part
[00:30:12] of the founding team I think it is hard
[00:30:13] to build what is called an AI company.
[00:30:15] uh in general if I look at the founder
[00:30:17] persona I am seeing
[00:30:20] you you have a much broader vantage but
[00:30:21] I'm seeing the lack of one specific type
[00:30:24] of founder archetype I used to see I I'm
[00:30:26] seeing a lot of very young kids were
[00:30:28] right out of college or in college it's
[00:30:29] crazy a bunch of my my kids are in
[00:30:31] college and some of their classmates I
[00:30:33] see them pitching me I'm like holy cow
[00:30:36] 20 something they're fearless I mean
[00:30:38] they're completely they've grown up with
[00:30:39] AI another another one is people from
[00:30:41] research labs and they've been in uh
[00:30:43] deep mind or or fair or something that's
[00:30:45] The second person are third person is
[00:30:47] repeat entrepreneurs. They've had a
[00:30:48] moderate success. What I'm seeing less
[00:30:50] of
[00:30:51] >> is people with
[00:30:53] >> exactly what you're going to say
[00:30:54] >> at a company. I think they are less
[00:30:56] they're more nervous. Why? Because they
[00:30:59] came up they came of age in a company
[00:31:01] which is not AI. They've they have
[00:31:03] they've kind of gotten to a mid
[00:31:04] mid-level manager role and now they're
[00:31:06] like okay. So I am not seeing those
[00:31:08] people raise their hands and start
[00:31:10] companies. So that that persona would be
[00:31:11] a very active entrepreneurial persona 3
[00:31:14] five years ago. Now I'm seeing much less
[00:31:16] of those kind of people.
[00:31:17] >> At least in our SPC part of the world,
[00:31:18] we're definitely seeing we're seeing all
[00:31:20] of this play out. We're definitely
[00:31:21] seeing more younger folks. Basically,
[00:31:23] people who don't have any to
[00:31:24] unlearn, you know, like there's no
[00:31:26] baggage. There's no baggage to let go
[00:31:28] of. They're like a they're smart and
[00:31:29] they're kind of like first principles.
[00:31:31] They'll just learn the new thing.
[00:31:33] >> Um and number two, it's the repeat
[00:31:35] entrepreneurs. the basically the people
[00:31:36] who have already in some ways you know
[00:31:38] that they have grit, resilience and kind
[00:31:40] of like drive and they're like oh this
[00:31:42] is a beautiful time of platform change
[00:31:43] to go apply something but we are seeing
[00:31:46] less you're right of like kind of the
[00:31:50] >> whatever like you know the seven eight
[00:31:51] years at like a high-flying company or
[00:31:53] like a unicorn who because for them it
[00:31:56] is unclear if what they're great at
[00:31:59] actually is that interesting or relevant
[00:32:01] you know like frankly if you have spent
[00:32:04] the last you know 10 at a place like you
[00:32:06] know places that we love Facebook,
[00:32:08] Google, Meta and Google
[00:32:11] I often wonder I'm like man were you
[00:32:12] doing things the old way because I
[00:32:14] suspect you're doing things the old way
[00:32:16] and in fact like your old way is going
[00:32:18] to get out competed by somebody who's
[00:32:19] not going to have that baggage. Um,
[00:32:22] >> and the same I mean I think one of the
[00:32:23] hardest I feel in some ways sad that I'm
[00:32:26] not in the job market or not working in
[00:32:28] some ways that because it's such an
[00:32:29] incredible thing to actually working but
[00:32:31] I also feel man the skills I mean the
[00:32:34] head of product role these are some
[00:32:35] later stage companies is one of the
[00:32:36] hardest roles to hire for today because
[00:32:39] >> everyone wants people who are fluent in
[00:32:41] AI. How the hell are you going to get
[00:32:43] ahead of product who's fluent in AI?
[00:32:44] Most people who are fluent in AI have
[00:32:46] one or two years of experience.
[00:32:47] >> Exactly.
[00:32:47] >> They're not necessary head of product.
[00:32:48] So it's I have seen a lot in fact I
[00:32:50] tweeted about this a lot of people have
[00:32:52] gone back to becoming IC's and that is
[00:32:55] what I really want to see
[00:32:58] >> go back to being IC go back to being an
[00:33:00] IC learn the basics work at that kind of
[00:33:03] engineering product whatever it is it
[00:33:05] shows humility it shows a beginner's
[00:33:06] mindset it shows
[00:33:08] >> because the people management stuff you
[00:33:09] you'll get back if you're a good people
[00:33:11] manager it's not going to go away it's
[00:33:12] like riding a bike but understanding
[00:33:14] this new thing you can't lead a team
[00:33:17] unless you know the technology unless
[00:33:18] you know how the damn thing works
[00:33:20] >> and so go and go and build some real
[00:33:21] hands-on skills and show that you can do
[00:33:23] the work. I completely agree. And
[00:33:25] you know, it's interesting because um I
[00:33:28] think coming back to you, you said this
[00:33:29] in passing a little bit. The only real
[00:33:31] way to become an AI expert today is to
[00:33:33] just use these damn things all the time.
[00:33:36] >> Like like instead of reaching for your
[00:33:38] default like workflow, make use AI to do
[00:33:41] it. Build a small tool. That is the only
[00:33:43] way that you can figure out what the
[00:33:45] limits of this technology is. And it can
[00:33:46] be frustrating because it will feel like
[00:33:48] you have to go slow to go fast. But all
[00:33:51] the truly AI native people are just
[00:33:52] using this all the time, right? Um, and
[00:33:55] I think that is literally the only way
[00:33:57] to learn because nobody has built up
[00:33:59] tribal knowledge that you can learn from
[00:34:00] yet.
[00:34:01] >> Yeah, Julie Xiao actually our our dear
[00:34:04] friend and colleague from Facebook.
[00:34:05] >> She basically had a very good podcast a
[00:34:07] few days ago where I think she said
[00:34:09] something that really made me think. I
[00:34:10] had been thinking about it but she
[00:34:11] articulated well. She said that I think
[00:34:13] she said the captain planet model is
[00:34:15] breaking where she said there are all
[00:34:16] these planets product engineing design
[00:34:19] which used to be traditional pods where
[00:34:20] you have a product person engineering
[00:34:22] design analytics now
[00:34:24] >> you just have two or three people who
[00:34:25] are all builders and you can't classify
[00:34:27] them uh you can't say is it a product
[00:34:29] person engineering so increasingly
[00:34:31] hearing this need for polymaths u design
[00:34:34] hey you know what I also want you to be
[00:34:36] able to do some front end engineering I
[00:34:37] want you to be able to understand
[00:34:38] product and customers product I want to
[00:34:39] be able to understand engineering and so
[00:34:41] on maybe you're better at one or two and
[00:34:43] but you need to know you have to have a
[00:34:45] T- shape more and more and more maybe
[00:34:47] you spike on one thing and Julie was
[00:34:49] taking to the extreme saying everyone
[00:34:51] has to know everything I think that's
[00:34:52] still there's still some esoteric things
[00:34:54] like building an iOS app if you want to
[00:34:56] do that final thing you need I had a I
[00:34:58] worked somebody who was an IC8 or IC iOS
[00:35:00] engineer and that's the only thing he
[00:35:02] did he didn't know anything about
[00:35:03] backend but he was damn good at that and
[00:35:05] we needed someone like that but maybe
[00:35:06] you need one of those for a company one
[00:35:08] or two of those amazing people but
[00:35:10] everyone else is a polymath who's able
[00:35:11] to do a bunch of things. You need one
[00:35:13] designer specialist who can make sure
[00:35:15] your design rules and are there.
[00:35:16] >> Now you're making me want to go, you
[00:35:18] know, I I always tell people I think I
[00:35:19] was a pretty good engineer.
[00:35:21] >> You're a damn good product guy and a
[00:35:23] damn good designer.
[00:35:24] >> I was more like I kind of like to do it
[00:35:26] a bunch of different things. So perhaps,
[00:35:28] you know, I should go back and get more
[00:35:30] leverage. Um, but to your point, I think
[00:35:32] it is really I think that's actually
[00:35:34] really well said by Julie and
[00:35:36] articulated by you as well, which is
[00:35:38] like I think today if you're not
[00:35:39] actually feeling that you can cross over
[00:35:41] like the prior boundaries you set for
[00:35:43] yourself
[00:35:44] >> like you you are then not using AI
[00:35:46] correctly, right? Like
[00:35:47] >> so actually I would say then I let go
[00:35:49] back to our founding team. The founding
[00:35:51] team just like we we expect the the
[00:35:53] hustler and the hacker prototype. The
[00:35:55] hustler we expect to do sales,
[00:35:56] marketing, everything. The hacker
[00:35:58] actually should
[00:35:59] many different things.
[00:36:01] >> Correct.
[00:36:01] >> It's not a pure engineering. It could be
[00:36:02] someone who's engineering, product
[00:36:03] design. We expect them to do many many
[00:36:05] many things.
[00:36:05] >> Yeah. And honestly like today if I were
[00:36:08] running a in an interview for like kind
[00:36:10] of like a founding engineer or maybe
[00:36:11] even a founding CTO if you wanted to,
[00:36:14] right? If if you give them a problem and
[00:36:16] they don't return you a pretty polished
[00:36:18] end to end up and down solution within
[00:36:20] two hours like then what like there that
[00:36:22] means they're not using AI correctly.
[00:36:24] like because like the AI can like it
[00:36:26] should allow you to do that right um and
[00:36:29] if they cannot speak intelligently about
[00:36:31] the nuances of GPT5 for coding versus
[00:36:34] like you know Opus 42 and where it
[00:36:36] excels where it doesn't why they might
[00:36:39] like you know replet versus winer versus
[00:36:41] kind of like um cursor like that means
[00:36:44] they're not actually thinking about
[00:36:45] their tools hard enough you know like um
[00:36:48] >> this is why there's so much AI fear I
[00:36:50] mean in some ways because not only do
[00:36:52] you have to do your job on a day-to-day,
[00:36:54] but you've also now got to learn a new
[00:36:56] way of doing things and stay on top of
[00:36:58] this incredibly fast growing innovative
[00:37:00] cycle with dozens of companies with
[00:37:02] dozens of new tools and technology.
[00:37:03] >> I mean, Google like I used to be a very
[00:37:06] avid reader like I used to try to read
[00:37:08] call it like you know a book every two
[00:37:10] weeks. I haven't touched a single book
[00:37:11] for the last 3 years or actually four
[00:37:13] years because I I'm like listen I I I as
[00:37:16] an investor I need to know what's
[00:37:17] happening right. So every spare moment
[00:37:20] I'm learning about like you know these
[00:37:21] models playing with these models and
[00:37:23] there's a sense of like
[00:37:25] >> you're it's this maybe fear is the wrong
[00:37:27] word but there is a sense of like being
[00:37:30] overwhelmed there's a lot going on right
[00:37:32] like no matter how hard you try you
[00:37:34] cannot keep up with everything you try
[00:37:35] your best right uh but there we live in
[00:37:39] in very like profoundly in some ways
[00:37:42] fast times right now in a way that I've
[00:37:44] never seen
[00:37:44] >> in some ways unsettling unsettling yeah
[00:37:47] exactly we could go on for a very long
[00:37:49] time. But yeah, this is this is fun. Um
[00:37:53] perhaps I'll ask you uh one question to
[00:37:55] kind of finish off here, right? Um
[00:37:58] >> if you
[00:38:00] what are you know if you could you know
[00:38:01] we talked about kind of your minus one
[00:38:03] stories. We talked about obviously the
[00:38:05] team. We talked about a little bit how
[00:38:07] you construct good missions, but like if
[00:38:10] you could almost like put a clarion call
[00:38:12] out into the ecosystem for like hey
[00:38:14] these are some missions that you want to
[00:38:16] see kind of get tackled. What would you
[00:38:18] kind of like ask people to think about?
[00:38:21] >> I would like to ask people to think
[00:38:22] about broadly speaking AI and the
[00:38:24] physical world.
[00:38:25] >> Yes.
[00:38:26] >> Um I feel we are living a lot in the
[00:38:28] digital world. The reality is the
[00:38:29] physical world is and know there is lot
[00:38:32] of a lot of things that are wrong and
[00:38:35] busted and failing and can be done
[00:38:36] better with AI. So I am I'm a huge fan
[00:38:39] of AI projects whether it's for defense
[00:38:41] resilience whether it's for building
[00:38:43] dams better humanoid robots how does AI
[00:38:46] manifest itself in the physical world
[00:38:48] and I think that's the other part of
[00:38:50] being a polymath I think all of us
[00:38:52] learned computer science electrical
[00:38:54] engineering and mechanical engineering
[00:38:55] got a different beast now I think Elon
[00:38:58] is one of the first few people that has
[00:39:00] built a company that transcends all of
[00:39:01] that and I think we're going to have to
[00:39:03] really bring a bunch of disciplines
[00:39:04] together computer science is not just in
[00:39:06] this thing toy world. How do we fuse
[00:39:09] electrical engine, computer science,
[00:39:10] mechanical engineing, all of those
[00:39:11] together?
[00:39:12] >> Yeah. I mean, I think as a computer
[00:39:13] scientist myself, right, like the
[00:39:15] challenge to me has really been like,
[00:39:17] you know,
[00:39:17] >> CM which is known for robotics.
[00:39:19] >> Robotics. I know. So, like my take is
[00:39:21] like my god like why can't we all build
[00:39:23] robots? Actually, probably the biggest
[00:39:24] area of investment for us at SPC uh like
[00:39:28] the new area of investment for us over
[00:39:30] the last call it two years has been kind
[00:39:32] of like physical like physical world and
[00:39:33] AI. So, robotics, drones, uh, foundation
[00:39:36] models specific to the physical world,
[00:39:39] uh, and so on. So, it's it's a very
[00:39:41] exciting time there. And honestly, even
[00:39:42] if 10% or 20% of of all of that stuff
[00:39:46] comes to fruition, our lived experience
[00:39:47] will be very different.
[00:39:49] >> That's right.
[00:39:49] >> Yeah.
[00:39:50] >> That's right.
[00:39:50] >> Um, well, Google, thank you. You know, I
[00:39:52] like I said, we could continue talking
[00:39:53] forever. Your wealth of experience, you
[00:39:56] know, I've I feel as though I've learned
[00:39:57] a bunch. I'm kind of going to change
[00:39:58] some of my like, you know, mental models
[00:40:00] on how to think about, you know, great
[00:40:02] founders and great things to invest in.
[00:40:03] But thank you as always for everything
[00:40:05] you do for the community. Thank you for
[00:40:06] sharing some of your stories and your
[00:40:07] tips.
[00:40:08] >> Thank you for starting SPC. It's a it's
[00:40:10] an incredible thing for the community.
[00:40:11] Thank you.
[00:40:11] >> I appreciate you. Uh, all right. Thank
[00:40:13] you. All right. Take care.
