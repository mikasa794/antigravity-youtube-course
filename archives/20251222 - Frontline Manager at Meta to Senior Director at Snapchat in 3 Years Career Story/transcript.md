[00:00:00] No matter what happens, you should never
[00:00:02] fire the first 15 engineers in the
[00:00:04] company. This is Ryan. He grew from a
[00:00:07] frontline manager at Facebook to a
[00:00:09] senior director at Snapchat in 3 years
[00:00:11] and shared everything he learned along
[00:00:13] the way.
[00:00:13] >> A very critical cultural philosophy I
[00:00:16] learned from Facebook is that everyone
[00:00:18] who work on engineering need to be
[00:00:20] technical.
[00:00:21] >> At Snapchat, he shared interesting
[00:00:23] learnings working with the founder and
[00:00:24] CEO. Evan have a really high bar for
[00:00:27] performance and it reminds me Steve
[00:00:29] Jobs.
[00:00:29] >> Part [snorts] of his growth was from job
[00:00:31] hopping to a director role at Square and
[00:00:33] then you were thrust into a director
[00:00:35] role. What were the biggest gaps that
[00:00:37] you [music] saw?
[00:00:38] >> There's a lot of gaps but the biggest
[00:00:39] gap I saw.
[00:00:41] >> Here's the full episode. [music]
[00:00:46] I'd like to go into one of the first
[00:00:47] legs of your career which is when you
[00:00:49] joined Facebook. What is the story
[00:00:51] behind you joining Facebook? Yeah. So I
[00:00:54] think that's an interesting story. My
[00:00:55] career path is a little bit
[00:00:57] nontraditional. I was a PhD. I used to
[00:00:59] be a research world for more than eight
[00:01:01] years. So and because after I graduate,
[00:01:04] I spent five years in PhD program and
[00:01:06] then I spent another three years in IBM
[00:01:08] as a research scientist mostly focused
[00:01:10] on computer vision and machine learning,
[00:01:12] right?
[00:01:13] And then I start to realize um
[00:01:16] industrial research model like IBM
[00:01:18] research or Microsoft research with this
[00:01:20] kind of 50% mix between research and
[00:01:22] engineerings it's probably not going to
[00:01:25] be sustainable.
[00:01:26] I have to choose either 100% on research
[00:01:30] or 100% on engineering one way or the
[00:01:32] others. So that's why that was back in
[00:01:35] the year of like 2009 I started to
[00:01:37] reflect on that. Then I start to
[00:01:39] question myself okay which path I should
[00:01:41] go. There are three paths in front of
[00:01:44] me. One is that I can be a faculty in
[00:01:46] some school. In fact I do an interview
[00:01:48] with some top school at that time or I
[00:01:51] can be a quant developer or quant trader
[00:01:54] in a financial engineering firm. I also
[00:01:56] have offers from some of the top
[00:01:59] quantitative trading firms or I go to a
[00:02:02] software engineering company like
[00:02:04] Facebook. So when I was thinking deeper
[00:02:07] first I want to be software engineers. I
[00:02:10] think that's the way that you can
[00:02:11] creating something that was influence
[00:02:13] more people than just doing trading.
[00:02:17] The second thing is that I want to go to
[00:02:18] a places that can make engineering to be
[00:02:21] the first class citizens. I think in the
[00:02:24] financial world engineering is always a
[00:02:26] second class. It's not a first class. I
[00:02:28] can be a faculty but being faculty I
[00:02:31] think the impact is smaller because you
[00:02:33] can only impact the scale of a school or
[00:02:37] maybe the community but not the entire
[00:02:39] world. So that's why that was the years
[00:02:42] I make up my minds that I want to be in
[00:02:44] the software engineering world and then
[00:02:46] if I want to be a software engineering
[00:02:47] ro I want to join a company that are
[00:02:49] fast growing and have the potentials to
[00:02:52] influence a lot of people and I think
[00:02:55] Facebook it is the one that fits with my
[00:02:58] criteria. So that's why I'm lucky enough
[00:03:01] to be part of a Facebook during the fast
[00:03:03] growing years like in the early 29th. So
[00:03:07] I think at Facebook you you transitioned
[00:03:09] into management and I think the things
[00:03:12] in your career that I'm most interested
[00:03:14] in is at the subsequent two companies at
[00:03:17] Square and at Snapchat. Your career had
[00:03:20] explosive growth because at Square I saw
[00:03:23] you were there for a little over a year
[00:03:25] and you went from a frontline manager to
[00:03:29] a director. Your team was around 40 plus
[00:03:32] engineers. So I'm kind of curious to dig
[00:03:35] into how you got that opportunity and
[00:03:38] how that growth came.
[00:03:40] >> Yeah, I'll be very transparent here. In
[00:03:42] fact, like when I joined Square, I was
[00:03:44] taking a director offer to join the
[00:03:45] square.
[00:03:46] >> Oh, okay. So you signed up with a team
[00:03:48] that was uh already director size.
[00:03:51] >> Exactly. Yeah. So and of course Square
[00:03:53] is a smaller company. So that's why they
[00:03:55] are willing to give me the opportunity
[00:03:57] to perform at a director level. after I
[00:04:00] joined the company um when I started the
[00:04:02] team it's about 25 people and then I
[00:04:05] grow the teams into 50 plus people in a
[00:04:07] years before I left the company so um I
[00:04:10] I indeed spend a lot of time to grow the
[00:04:13] machine learning teams and data science
[00:04:15] infrastructure teams like back in square
[00:04:17] I think it's actually a very helpful
[00:04:19] exercise but one thing I do have to say
[00:04:21] that and in fact this is one of the the
[00:04:24] lesson learned for myself is that I do
[00:04:28] things like my transitions from managers
[00:04:31] to director teach me a lot of things. I
[00:04:34] start to learn a lot about the
[00:04:38] difference between line managers and
[00:04:40] directors and why they call it
[00:04:42] directors.
[00:04:44] So because director is about directing
[00:04:47] instead of managings. So it really
[00:04:50] opened my mind about what's the right
[00:04:53] way to managing managers instead of
[00:04:56] managing IC's. So you need to use a
[00:04:59] completely different philosophy to do
[00:05:00] that and it takes me some time to adjust
[00:05:02] to it but after this exercise I think
[00:05:05] I've become a better managers at a
[00:05:07] different level.
[00:05:09] >> Yeah. I'm curious because you your
[00:05:11] career grew so quickly that I wonder if
[00:05:14] there were any skill gaps. You were you
[00:05:16] went from a frontline manager and then
[00:05:18] you were thrust into a director role. Um
[00:05:20] what were the biggest gaps that you saw?
[00:05:23] >> Yep. So the there's a lot of gaps but
[00:05:26] the biggest gap I saw it's about back to
[00:05:29] the word directing when I first step
[00:05:31] into the director role I actually don't
[00:05:33] understand the difference between
[00:05:35] director versus managers but when I
[00:05:38] start to practice it I start to realize
[00:05:40] like managing and managers require
[00:05:43] different set of skill because like
[00:05:45] typically the line managers are the one
[00:05:47] that knows the detail the best unlike my
[00:05:50] Facebook experience I grow from IC to
[00:05:52] become a managers then I'm the one in
[00:05:55] the teams knows most of the details. So
[00:05:57] that's why I continue I can continue to
[00:06:00] use that as the anchor points to
[00:06:02] managing other people because almost
[00:06:04] most the other people in my teams join
[00:06:06] after me. So that's why I'm the senior
[00:06:08] people in the rooms but you start to go
[00:06:10] to a new environment you become the more
[00:06:12] junior people in the company but you
[00:06:15] actually leading the more senior people
[00:06:17] in the in their tenurs of the company.
[00:06:19] they are more senior and but you are
[00:06:21] leading them and also they know more
[00:06:24] details than you then what's the right
[00:06:27] way for me being a director positions to
[00:06:31] actually provide my values to those
[00:06:34] people that's the most interesting part
[00:06:36] of it if because like I don't think I do
[00:06:38] well in the first half a year and once I
[00:06:40] don't do well they may start to just
[00:06:42] feel like okay why do I actually need
[00:06:44] this layer at all because I'm not adding
[00:06:47] any values to their their daily life. So
[00:06:51] and that was the time I start to reflect
[00:06:53] is that if I'm becoming a middle layers
[00:06:57] between them and the higher level
[00:07:00] executive what are the value that I
[00:07:04] should bring in for the organizations.
[00:07:06] So I think like what you end up landing
[00:07:09] on it will be about like high level
[00:07:13] thinking about strategical directions
[00:07:16] about like the possibility that you can
[00:07:20] help to collect resource across
[00:07:22] different department about like solving
[00:07:25] the most difficult problem for the
[00:07:28] organizations. It's all about those kind
[00:07:30] of a directions and that's why it speak
[00:07:33] to the difference between directing and
[00:07:36] managing. So it's no longer simply about
[00:07:38] managing people anymore. It's about
[00:07:40] directing an organizations towards to a
[00:07:44] better positions in the futures. So
[00:07:47] essentially it means you need to operate
[00:07:49] at a very different level than what it
[00:07:50] used to be. So it takes takes me some
[00:07:53] time to understand it. So the thing that
[00:07:55] took you from maybe underperforming
[00:07:58] initially to fitting into the director
[00:08:01] role was you stepped away from directly
[00:08:04] managing people and you thought more
[00:08:06] strategically about the the group and
[00:08:08] that you were leading. Yeah. So that's
[00:08:10] totally the case and also like put some
[00:08:12] more salt around what does your direct
[00:08:15] report was looking for from you. So, and
[00:08:18] there's some there's definitely a
[00:08:19] reasons why the original leader choose
[00:08:23] not to promote any of the existing
[00:08:25] leader into my role. Instead, they
[00:08:27] choose to hire another person's into
[00:08:30] that role. There must be a reason behind
[00:08:32] that. And this means that there is must
[00:08:34] be an area for improvement for them. as
[00:08:36] a leader myself then I need to make it
[00:08:40] clear and then need to understand that
[00:08:41] okay what I can do to help to grow that
[00:08:45] persons from their current levels to the
[00:08:49] next level what's the missing pieces
[00:08:52] like what other thing I can help them so
[00:08:54] and when I start to understand that that
[00:08:56] going back to my analogy of like
[00:09:00] comparing management to psychological
[00:09:02] doctors right so you start to understand
[00:09:05] what they are looking for and then you I
[00:09:07] will align my work towards that and once
[00:09:12] you start to do that then you start to
[00:09:14] get more respect from those people
[00:09:16] because they understand that you are
[00:09:18] here to help them to grow to the next
[00:09:20] level. So yeah I think that's that's
[00:09:22] sort of a turning point for my director
[00:09:24] career. I can imagine that there's a
[00:09:27] psychological effect here if someone
[00:09:29] gets hired a level above you. You know
[00:09:31] maybe these people were hoping for that.
[00:09:34] Did you deal with any incidents like
[00:09:37] that and how do you how do you handle
[00:09:40] that kind of situation?
[00:09:42] >> So first yeah I definitely dealt with
[00:09:44] that because it's a it's a human nature
[00:09:46] things everyone want to get promoted and
[00:09:50] everyone will questions why they are not
[00:09:52] the one that could promote it. So that's
[00:09:55] why the way to handle that is to really
[00:09:58] help them to understand that with me
[00:10:01] coming in it's actually much better
[00:10:04] situation for them in terms of their
[00:10:06] career instead of a negative
[00:10:10] and in that cases you need to find a
[00:10:13] common ground between you and your
[00:10:15] direct report. So you are not a blocker
[00:10:18] for their career instead but you are
[00:10:20] actually a promoter for their career.
[00:10:23] And this is actually one thing I only
[00:10:25] realized half years after I become the
[00:10:27] director to be honest. So but after I do
[00:10:29] that I think I'm doing much better in my
[00:10:31] following career in the future is that
[00:10:32] every single time when I go to a new
[00:10:35] places the number one thing I would do
[00:10:37] is to build a trust layer and this is a
[00:10:39] place I really recommend a book called
[00:10:41] the five dysfunctions of a teams. I
[00:10:43] think that book taught me a lot also. I
[00:10:46] mean basically the book one of the key
[00:10:48] narrative for that book it's about um
[00:10:52] the most foundational layer for a
[00:10:55] successful team it is trust everything
[00:10:57] building on top of trust so that's the
[00:10:59] first things I would do is to build up a
[00:11:02] trust relationships with that person's
[00:11:05] so he need to trust me that I'm here to
[00:11:07] help him then I need to start to execute
[00:11:10] a few things to make him understand that
[00:11:13] so and also you need to help him to
[00:11:16] unblock some of the things that he
[00:11:18] cannot unblock himself. That also shows
[00:11:20] the value of you being an upper
[00:11:22] management to help your people. So I
[00:11:25] think that become more and more
[00:11:27] important things like so for for
[00:11:29] building a successful teams. You
[00:11:31] mentioned that you were hired in as a
[00:11:32] director. So that makes me think about
[00:11:35] let's say you are a really ambitious
[00:11:38] manager and you're thinking about how
[00:11:40] can you grow and level and you know
[00:11:42] there's the approach of staying
[00:11:44] somewhere trying to get promoted and
[00:11:46] then there's also job hopping. Do you
[00:11:49] think that job hopping is kind of the
[00:11:51] best way to to jump up tiers as a
[00:11:55] manager?
[00:11:57] >> I never think about job hopping is the
[00:11:59] best way to jump up to the managers.
[00:12:01] Yeah. In fact, even when I talk about
[00:12:03] Facebook, a lot of my OT team members
[00:12:07] are already in a very high level. Some
[00:12:09] of my friends are already VP of
[00:12:11] engineering in Facebook. So that's why I
[00:12:14] don't think job hopping is the always
[00:12:17] the the only way or the right way to do
[00:12:19] it. But I can speak to like why I choose
[00:12:22] to do that. My philosophy is about
[00:12:25] northstar. I always have a northstar
[00:12:28] goal in my mind is that I want to become
[00:12:31] a CTO at some point for a AI company.
[00:12:35] >> You did it.
[00:12:35] >> So [laughter]
[00:12:37] thank you. Yeah. So that that that has
[00:12:40] been a no struggle even like after I get
[00:12:43] my PhD degree for m for machine
[00:12:45] learning. I have been imagining a well
[00:12:48] at some point that AI can become a
[00:12:51] business by itself. But when I when I
[00:12:54] graduated, the world is not like that. I
[00:12:57] mean AI is just always amplifiers.
[00:13:00] It's just like a component in a bigger
[00:13:03] company who can make the business
[00:13:04] better. That's interesting, but that's
[00:13:06] not the most interesting part of it. So
[00:13:09] that's why when I start to make up my
[00:13:11] mind that this is my northstar goal,
[00:13:12] then I want to make a plan out of it. My
[00:13:16] plan is that if I want to become a CTO,
[00:13:19] I have a lot of a weak link for that.
[00:13:22] Especially when I coming after my
[00:13:24] research career, I know from a being a
[00:13:27] research scientist to be a CTO, there's
[00:13:30] a lot of gap. So I recognize my gap.
[00:13:33] It's about not understanding the
[00:13:36] industry, how industry operate, don't
[00:13:38] understanding infrastructure and back
[00:13:40] end, don't understand front end than
[00:13:42] product and don't understand like many
[00:13:45] other things. So that's why I need to
[00:13:47] choose my career to help me to fill in
[00:13:50] those gap step by step. And in fact,
[00:13:52] here's a story. Before I joined
[00:13:54] Snapchat, I'm always a data and machine
[00:13:56] learning person. All of my position was
[00:13:58] related to data and machine learning.
[00:14:01] And when I joined Snapchat, there are
[00:14:02] two option in front of me. Either I
[00:14:04] choose to become the director of data or
[00:14:07] I choose to become director of camera,
[00:14:10] which is the first page of Snapchat.
[00:14:13] I intentionally choose to become the
[00:14:15] director of camera and I need to learn
[00:14:18] about iOS and Android programming from
[00:14:20] scratch. I literally spend like two
[00:14:21] months learn about iOS programming.
[00:14:23] Again, I think this is a very
[00:14:25] unconventional choices because I believe
[00:14:27] most people would just like go with
[00:14:28] director of data because that's the
[00:14:30] that's most comfortable selection you
[00:14:32] can make.
[00:14:34] But my northstar is trying to become a
[00:14:36] CTO. I think in order to become a CTO, I
[00:14:38] need to understand product. I need to
[00:14:40] understand working with product managers
[00:14:43] and product designer and arguably if you
[00:14:46] just like follow your traditional career
[00:14:48] progression within a company it's really
[00:14:50] hard to do that it's really hard to jump
[00:14:53] from a backend team to a more product
[00:14:55] facing teams at that point so I think
[00:14:58] that I actually take that as a very
[00:14:59] great opportunity to challenge myself to
[00:15:02] run something difference and to inch
[00:15:04] towards towards my what I'm looking for
[00:15:07] at the end so and I'm glad Yeah, make
[00:15:09] that choice. In fact, the first two
[00:15:11] years in Snapchat is probably one of the
[00:15:13] happiest periods for my career because I
[00:15:15] really enjoy that period. I'm learning
[00:15:17] new things. I find that myself was
[00:15:20] developing my knowledge base every
[00:15:22] single day and
[00:15:25] and I that's the reasons why I was like
[00:15:28] choosing different things at different
[00:15:30] stage of my career. you worked in very
[00:15:33] different domains in as an engineering
[00:15:35] leader and I was curious how much do the
[00:15:39] details of the teams that you manage
[00:15:42] matter. This is a very critical cultural
[00:15:46] philosophy I learned from Facebook is
[00:15:49] that everyone who work on engineering
[00:15:52] need to be technical. I still remember
[00:15:54] the times that like Facebook have this
[00:15:56] six weeks boot camp process. I don't
[00:15:57] know whether they still have it right
[00:15:58] now. So, but when back in times,
[00:16:00] everyone need to go into the six week
[00:16:02] boot camp process before they can choose
[00:16:04] a teams, right? And I remember there's a
[00:16:06] uh a VP level hires sitting right next
[00:16:09] to me and she's just like doing the same
[00:16:12] thing as what I was doing like finding
[00:16:13] bugs, fixing bugs, writing poll
[00:16:15] requests. She was doing that for six
[00:16:17] week. That actually shocks me because I
[00:16:20] come from IBM like IBM's VP never code
[00:16:23] anymore. I mean, I don't even they
[00:16:24] probably only write PBTs at the end, I
[00:16:26] think. But this is one things that was
[00:16:28] deeply planning in my heart afterwards
[00:16:31] is that I believe being technical being
[00:16:34] detail driven it's a very critical
[00:16:37] things for us success in the futures and
[00:16:40] that's also part of the reasons why I
[00:16:43] also love to get into detail these days.
[00:16:45] So I write I still write codes I still
[00:16:47] review codes like right now I at least
[00:16:49] write two or three porest every single
[00:16:51] week. I'm also the kind of person I'm
[00:16:54] not really good at speaking up if I
[00:16:56] don't know the details. I want to make
[00:16:59] sure that I understand the details so
[00:17:03] that I know I'm not making things so so
[00:17:05] that I can make the best strategic
[00:17:07] decisions for the teams. How how do you
[00:17:09] find that balance though? Because even
[00:17:11] as an IC there is some balance where you
[00:17:15] start to you know lower leverage tasks
[00:17:18] you start offloading them to scale
[00:17:20] yourself and you only take on the very
[00:17:22] critical things. I can't even imagine
[00:17:24] like as a CTO or director what even
[00:17:28] detailed work is worth picking up. I
[00:17:31] think the the best way to scale this is
[00:17:34] to always going back to your first
[00:17:36] principle. So at the beginning of every
[00:17:38] single week I will ask myself what are
[00:17:40] the top three things I need to achieve
[00:17:42] only focus on those top three things and
[00:17:44] then every everything else is less
[00:17:46] important. So and sometimes one of those
[00:17:49] top three things will be development
[00:17:51] getting the details. So I think that's
[00:17:55] very critical part of it. It's not. So
[00:17:57] that's why I'm not saying that every
[00:17:58] single week you need to do the same
[00:18:00] things, but every single week you need
[00:18:03] to have a themes for your work and you
[00:18:07] naturally understand how each themes is
[00:18:10] going to bring the best bang for the
[00:18:11] bucks for your north star goal. So
[00:18:14] that's why you keep recalibrating
[00:18:16] yourself towards it. And I think this is
[00:18:19] the best way to scale because like at
[00:18:21] the end every every every people only
[00:18:23] have eight hour working time or maybe 10
[00:18:25] or 12 working time every single day but
[00:18:27] that's it. So you you can't have more. I
[00:18:31] think the best people not really just
[00:18:33] like spending more time but they're
[00:18:35] really good at allocating their time and
[00:18:38] by understand the priority of each
[00:18:42] directions and spend the right time at
[00:18:44] each priorities. I understand that
[00:18:46] Snapchat is in Los Angeles which is you
[00:18:49] know very different from Silicon Valley.
[00:18:52] I'm curious did you notice a big
[00:18:53] difference in the cultures in LA versus
[00:18:57] Silicon Valley? Yeah. So I think
[00:18:59] specific for Snapchat the culture is
[00:19:02] actually very similar to Bay Area
[00:19:03] company and in fact when I joined
[00:19:05] Snapchat I found it surprisingly similar
[00:19:07] to Facebook's culture. It's all it's a
[00:19:10] moving fast places break things done is
[00:19:13] better than perfect. I all those things
[00:19:15] apply to both Facebook and Snapchat and
[00:19:18] partly because a lot of early people
[00:19:20] coming from Snapchat or working in
[00:19:22] Snapchat they come from Bay Area or
[00:19:24] Seattle. So that's why like Snapchat has
[00:19:26] built a culture very similar to that.
[00:19:28] But broadly speaking I think LA is a way
[00:19:31] more diverse space than Silicon Valley.
[00:19:33] I still remember like when I was living
[00:19:35] in Bay Area, I lived there for five, six
[00:19:37] years. Whenever I go to an event or a
[00:19:39] dinners like you can find that like most
[00:19:42] of the topic people talk about on the
[00:19:44] dinner table tech stock startups the
[00:19:50] topic are almost always the same. So
[00:19:52] because that's a that bring Bay Area to
[00:19:54] fame but also means that a lot of people
[00:19:56] was working on the same things. But in
[00:19:58] Los Angeles you get very different wipe.
[00:20:01] you get access to a lot of different
[00:20:03] kind of people. For example, um in my
[00:20:06] neighborhoods, one of my neighbor it's a
[00:20:09] it's a doctor. It's a medical doctor and
[00:20:11] another neighbor it's actually a
[00:20:12] cryptographer for Michael Jackson's. I
[00:20:15] think I can never get access to those
[00:20:17] kind of people when I was back in San
[00:20:18] Francisco. It really help you to broaden
[00:20:20] your views outside Silicon Valley. you
[00:20:24] start to understand that oh it turns out
[00:20:27] a lot of our people a lot of our users
[00:20:32] are not just techie are not just AI
[00:20:35] people instead there's a lot of common
[00:20:38] persons who can still benefit from your
[00:20:40] product and it help you to put yourself
[00:20:42] into their shoes to understand like how
[00:20:46] your product should be built in their
[00:20:47] cases I saw your team grew to the size
[00:20:50] of 250 engineers at Snapchat what drove
[00:20:53] grow that growth.
[00:20:54] >> I think we grow that organically in the
[00:20:56] sense that like Snapchat become a bigger
[00:20:58] company over times. I remember when I
[00:21:01] first joined Snapchat, the whole company
[00:21:04] only have 100 people. I'm probably the
[00:21:06] 100th employees and Snapchat grow into
[00:21:11] about 3,000 employee in two years. So
[00:21:14] that's why like my team size also grew
[00:21:16] together with that overall company
[00:21:18] growth. At the same time, of course,
[00:21:20] there's a lot of efforts putting into
[00:21:22] recruiting. Like really shout out to the
[00:21:23] recruiting teams. I mean, a lot of
[00:21:25] efforts like to our interviewers for
[00:21:27] making it happens. But overall, I think
[00:21:29] like for a size of a company that worth
[00:21:33] like tens of billion dollar, I think
[00:21:35] that's a reasonable size of a company
[00:21:36] that you can you want to build at that
[00:21:38] time. We do learn a lot from that
[00:21:42] process. And this is what I always call
[00:21:45] a painful period for fast growing. You
[00:21:48] will quickly realize the cultures that
[00:21:51] you want for a 100 people company is
[00:21:53] going to be very different from a
[00:21:55] culture for 3,000 people company. You
[00:21:58] will see a lot of different sort of a
[00:22:01] culture start to clash with each other
[00:22:04] and in a good way. So that's why every
[00:22:07] single time when you double your team,
[00:22:09] you almost like you're building a new
[00:22:10] company at that time. And this is the
[00:22:13] period that the leadership has to be
[00:22:15] very resilient and we need to be very
[00:22:18] adaptive to the new environment just
[00:22:20] cannot always just hold on to one thing
[00:22:23] to say okay I'm not going to change that
[00:22:24] like in fact that's different because we
[00:22:26] are building a very new company now we
[00:22:28] are very different company we need you
[00:22:30] use new way to think about the problems
[00:22:32] so yeah but that also really helped me
[00:22:34] to grow to seeing how you can grow a
[00:22:38] much smaller team to a much bigger team
[00:22:40] what kind of a process has you know go
[00:22:42] through to make it happen.
[00:22:43] >> As a senior director at Snapchat, I
[00:22:45] imagine you might have had some
[00:22:46] proximity to Evan Spiegel. Do you have
[00:22:48] any stories working with him and what
[00:22:50] made him effective?
[00:22:52] >> We do have direct access to Evan. So in
[00:22:55] fact um I work pretty closely with Evans
[00:22:59] like for a few projects. I really like
[00:23:01] Evan as a leaders. So and in fact the
[00:23:05] two things really strike my mind like
[00:23:08] when you work with Evans first Evan have
[00:23:11] a really high bar for performance.
[00:23:13] So and his bar is even at the pixel
[00:23:16] level and it reminds me of Steve Jobs.
[00:23:18] So and then basically for example in our
[00:23:20] product review if we show him a demo he
[00:23:24] will actually point out pixel level
[00:23:26] issues and ask us to fix. So that's why
[00:23:29] sometimes I would say that okay if we're
[00:23:31] building a demo we say you need to build
[00:23:33] a ready demo not a normal demo
[00:23:36] but that really helped him to be very
[00:23:39] successful in terms of like building a
[00:23:42] great product that's what he's really
[00:23:44] good at second thing is that I think he
[00:23:46] really care about personal connections
[00:23:49] especially with the engineers like he
[00:23:51] really keep his promise and uh he
[00:23:53] appreciate the value of engineerings so
[00:23:55] one thing I remember very clearly is
[00:23:57] that like he actually told one of our
[00:23:59] leader is that no matter what happens,
[00:24:03] you should never fire the first 15
[00:24:05] engineers in the company because they
[00:24:08] are the founding member for the company.
[00:24:10] Snapchat was like start in a in a place
[00:24:13] called a blue house. It's actually very
[00:24:14] small house uh back in Venice Beach and
[00:24:19] then because the company is growing
[00:24:20] expanding very quickly. So that's why
[00:24:22] they they no longer working in their
[00:24:24] small places. But after four years, I
[00:24:25] think it's 2017, like everyone bought
[00:24:28] their house back and then he start
[00:24:31] hosting the ball meeting back in their
[00:24:33] house.
[00:24:35] So you can see he's really deeply care
[00:24:37] about this kind of connections, this
[00:24:40] like personal relationships. And that
[00:24:42] also probably explain why he was trying
[00:24:44] to build Snapchat and reach inherently
[00:24:47] it is a a tool that help people to build
[00:24:50] like more intimate connections and and
[00:24:53] creating like conversation with each
[00:24:55] other. So yeah, he's a he's a really
[00:24:58] good person for that.
[00:24:59] >> You know, after you left Snapchat, I saw
[00:25:01] that you went to a series of startups
[00:25:03] and now that you explained that your
[00:25:06] your overarching northstar, everything's
[00:25:08] now making sense. So now at this point
[00:25:10] it looks like you're starting to take on
[00:25:12] uh larger leadership roles at smaller
[00:25:15] and smaller companies. I'm kind of
[00:25:16] curious how does the recruiting work at
[00:25:19] these levels?
[00:25:20] >> Yeah, I have to be honest on this one.
[00:25:21] Maybe bragging a little bit but I never
[00:25:23] look for a new job myself. I never look
[00:25:25] for new jobs proactively at least. So it
[00:25:29] all it's all coming inbound like from
[00:25:31] either personal connections or like some
[00:25:34] recruiter outreach. And in most of the
[00:25:37] cases I I would prefer to go to a places
[00:25:40] that I actually have personal connection
[00:25:42] with because this is this is my
[00:25:44] fundamental belief. My fundamental
[00:25:47] belief is that no matter where I'm going
[00:25:49] to I'm going to go through upcycle and
[00:25:51] down cycle. There will be a period the
[00:25:53] company do well and there will be a
[00:25:55] period the company will not do well. And
[00:25:56] this is true for almost all company I've
[00:25:59] been to like Facebook and Square,
[00:26:02] Snapchat and like things like that,
[00:26:05] right? So I want to be not only I can
[00:26:09] grow with the company during the upcycle
[00:26:11] but I also want to grow with the company
[00:26:13] during the down cycle but in order to go
[00:26:16] through a down cycle I want to work with
[00:26:18] persons that I like and I can think a
[00:26:21] lot with them so that we can all working
[00:26:24] together as a team to go through that
[00:26:27] and that's why I really feel like
[00:26:29] personal connection is a big part of it
[00:26:31] for that decisions and the reality is
[00:26:34] that like it's It's a good time for
[00:26:36] engineerings in the sense that like I
[00:26:38] keep getting recruiting email almost
[00:26:40] every single week like for different
[00:26:42] positions but I ignore majority of those
[00:26:46] email but if it's a things come through
[00:26:49] my personal connections I value it way
[00:26:52] more I find that that actually will be
[00:26:55] the more interesting part that can help
[00:26:59] me to excel in the long term so that's
[00:27:01] why yeah this is basically my story yeah
[00:27:05] overall All I think all that also speak
[00:27:06] to the fact that building a professional
[00:27:09] network
[00:27:11] connections early and it's a very useful
[00:27:13] exercise. So because you never know this
[00:27:16] kind of opportunity when this kind of
[00:27:18] opportunity will come but you want to
[00:27:20] capture the opportunity when it arrive.
[00:27:23] How do you compare the roles that you
[00:27:25] that come your way? Because when you're
[00:27:27] in a wellestablished ladder, you know,
[00:27:30] you're a director, a director role comes
[00:27:32] and you kind of decide on some but let's
[00:27:34] say you're you're CTO of a certain
[00:27:37] company and you want to consider another
[00:27:39] leadership role at another smaller
[00:27:41] company. Do you is it number of people
[00:27:44] working there? Is it valuations? What
[00:27:47] how do you make those calls?
[00:27:49] >> To be honest, I never take those two
[00:27:50] things into account. The valuations are
[00:27:54] the people report to me. I actually want
[00:27:56] less people to report to me right now.
[00:27:58] So, but it's all anchor against my
[00:28:00] northstar goal. Yeah. So, maybe I bring
[00:28:03] that back before, but I want to bring
[00:28:05] this back to that also. I want to
[00:28:08] understand is that choice actually
[00:28:11] helped me to move closer to what I want
[00:28:13] to do. I start to feel like this is
[00:28:15] getting more and more important in my
[00:28:16] career because the the one things I
[00:28:19] gradually realized like when I was
[00:28:20] spending more time in the industry
[00:28:23] I start to realize levels and titles
[00:28:27] those are the things the company give
[00:28:30] that to you it's not your things and as
[00:28:33] an example my original I mean I would
[00:28:36] say my my role model uh 10 years ago was
[00:28:41] like senior people in a company like
[00:28:43] executive VP in a company, senior VP in
[00:28:46] a company. That was my role model. But I
[00:28:48] also start to realize when they left the
[00:28:50] company, you will immediately hear much
[00:28:52] less about them externally. I'm not
[00:28:56] saying that they are not doing
[00:28:57] meaningful work, but you seeing you're
[00:28:59] hearing less from them externally and
[00:29:02] people are still calling them XVP of
[00:29:04] some things. I start to realize, okay,
[00:29:07] yeah, the title it's about the company,
[00:29:10] it's not about you. So people are not
[00:29:12] going to say okay you did this things
[00:29:14] instead they will say the company did
[00:29:16] these things and the more I think about
[00:29:18] it the more I feel like okay maybe this
[00:29:20] is not what actually interest to me
[00:29:23] instead I want people to remember myself
[00:29:26] as someone who actually built this
[00:29:28] product that can make their life better
[00:29:31] I feel like that's actually way more
[00:29:32] fulfilling for myself so that's why like
[00:29:35] a lot of my decision end up anchoring
[00:29:37] towards that direction so you can see
[00:29:38] it's less about number of people I
[00:29:40] manage I don't care. It's less about
[00:29:43] like the valuation of a company. I don't
[00:29:46] care. I care more about am I doing
[00:29:49] something that are impactful right now.
[00:29:50] In fact, I literally joking to my
[00:29:52] friends yesterday is that I'm waiting
[00:29:54] for the times that two people can make a
[00:29:57] $1 billion company and it's probably
[00:29:59] going to come in pretty soon and you may
[00:30:01] not have any direct report at that time
[00:30:02] and that's totally okay because I'm
[00:30:05] making a lot of impact out of it. So
[00:30:09] that's actually what I want to anchor
[00:30:11] towards when we're trying to hire good
[00:30:15] talent. The number one thing I want to
[00:30:17] do is to be very honest and transparent
[00:30:19] to them why they should join hun and
[00:30:21] they should not join hun. So for anyone
[00:30:24] who join hent I want them to believe
[00:30:28] that we can grow into a much bigger
[00:30:30] company. Yeah. And also want them to
[00:30:33] believe there's like only 1% chance we
[00:30:36] can do that. But they have to believe in
[00:30:38] that because this will be a tough cycle
[00:30:43] and this will not be always smooth. This
[00:30:45] will you have a lot of bump to get
[00:30:48] there. So but I think I want people to
[00:30:51] feel feel excited about being part of it
[00:30:55] to go through this kind of up and down
[00:30:57] to get there. So and I think style is
[00:31:00] only good for that kind of people. It's
[00:31:02] interesting that you you want them to
[00:31:04] know that it's it's a very low chance of
[00:31:07] success. Why would you sell that to the
[00:31:10] candidate? I believe that's the winning
[00:31:12] strategies. I always [snorts] believe in
[00:31:15] the power of being honest and
[00:31:17] transparent. So, it's much better off
[00:31:20] they know that upfront and they
[00:31:21] intentionally make their choices to join
[00:31:23] us so that they won't leave the company
[00:31:26] when they start to see like some slight
[00:31:28] difficulty. I also believe that like
[00:31:30] when you go to a battlefield with the
[00:31:33] soldiers, you want all soldiers to be
[00:31:36] able to understand the difficulty
[00:31:38] they're going to face, but they are
[00:31:39] pumper for it. They're not going to
[00:31:41] scare by that. This is the kind of
[00:31:43] preparations we want to get after. So at
[00:31:46] the end, I'm not going to hire the
[00:31:47] entire world of the engineers, but I
[00:31:49] want to sift out 5% or the 1% of people
[00:31:53] who really truly want to go with us
[00:31:56] along this journey. And hopefully we can
[00:31:58] get that but we will do that with with
[00:32:00] like all the transparencies that we we
[00:32:03] we we can give that to them. Coming to
[00:32:05] the end of the conversation, I want to
[00:32:07] go over some, you know, career
[00:32:09] reflections. And, you know, one of the
[00:32:12] first things that I think was
[00:32:13] interesting to me about your career is
[00:32:15] you defined a north star on that you
[00:32:18] wanted to be a CTO at a AI first um
[00:32:22] company and that kind of guided all of
[00:32:24] your decisions. Whereas I see a lot of
[00:32:26] other people their career strategy is I
[00:32:30] want to become you know as high as I can
[00:32:32] go or I want to make as much money as I
[00:32:34] can or something like that. What's the
[00:32:36] pro and con of designing your your
[00:32:39] career um like you did as opposed to
[00:32:42] this external factors that a lot of
[00:32:44] people design their careers around.
[00:32:46] >> First I think there's no right or wrong
[00:32:48] for any of the criteria you just
[00:32:50] mentioned. In fact, I will even consider
[00:32:53] my career decision is a little bit
[00:32:55] non-conventional because for example, uh
[00:32:57] most of my friends back in IBM research,
[00:32:59] they would never choose to go to
[00:33:01] Facebook as a smaller company at that
[00:33:03] time. It's like the most common choices
[00:33:05] they're going to choose is go to a
[00:33:07] school to be a faculty or go to another
[00:33:10] industrial research lab to be another
[00:33:13] research scientist. And I think they can
[00:33:15] do really well also at that time. So
[00:33:17] that's why I don't think there's a right
[00:33:18] or wrong at this one. But it's really
[00:33:21] about like what you as a persons want to
[00:33:24] do and I one thing I believe is that
[00:33:27] everyone is different and everyone was
[00:33:29] motiving
[00:33:33] process are very important and my
[00:33:36] criteria will be let's say 15 years
[00:33:40] later if I choose to retire at that time
[00:33:43] if I look back at my career am I feel
[00:33:46] regret for anything am I feel regret of
[00:33:49] not doing this things. If I would feel
[00:33:52] regret, I rather do it now. So, and then
[00:33:56] I know that I will feel regret if I
[00:33:59] never do an AI company
[00:34:02] and make that happens. I'll probably
[00:34:04] feel regret. So, that's why I rather do
[00:34:06] it now in this moment. When it comes to
[00:34:09] regrets, uh is there anything that you
[00:34:12] feel like you you wish you changed along
[00:34:14] your career path that others could learn
[00:34:16] from?
[00:34:17] >> This is a very good questions. Yeah,
[00:34:19] there's a lot of things I can change and
[00:34:22] I would say that in fact my career
[00:34:24] progression is not the smoothest
[00:34:25] progressions. So maybe back to my very
[00:34:28] first questions if you ask me whether I
[00:34:30] would choose PhD or not. If I know that
[00:34:33] I'm going to software engineering, I'm
[00:34:35] probably not going to choose that. But
[00:34:37] it doesn't really means that I did not
[00:34:38] learn anything from my P get anything
[00:34:40] out of it. But it is not the most like
[00:34:43] smoothest path that you can get. So and
[00:34:47] then but there's no such things in the
[00:34:49] world that I can have a magic wand to
[00:34:51] predict what's going to happen in the
[00:34:53] next 10 years and to be honest I cannot
[00:34:54] even predict what AI is going to happens
[00:34:57] in the next three months. So [snorts]
[00:34:59] that's why I think the most important
[00:35:01] thing I realized is never take anything
[00:35:04] for granted. Always learn to adapt.
[00:35:07] Always be able to like learn about the
[00:35:10] new knowledge as quickly as possible and
[00:35:13] adapt yourself. And if you have a
[00:35:16] short-term setback, for example, while
[00:35:18] you are why I'm transitioning from
[00:35:20] research world into a engineering world
[00:35:23] or transition from a line managers to a
[00:35:25] director, don't be disappointed. This is
[00:35:28] just a moment for adjustment and learn
[00:35:30] how to adjust and you'll be a better
[00:35:33] self afterwards. I think a lot of your
[00:35:35] like when I look at your career, a lot
[00:35:37] of your growth, if I were to plot it, it
[00:35:40] really kind of took off when you got the
[00:35:43] Square director offer and then also when
[00:35:46] you went to Snapchat and Snapchat grew a
[00:35:48] ton and um you know some some of that
[00:35:52] growth is opportunity and it seems you
[00:35:55] know there's a Snapchat could have also
[00:35:57] went down too but you you had the right
[00:36:00] situation, the right market um for you
[00:36:03] to have the career growth that you had
[00:36:05] at that time. I'm kind of curious how
[00:36:08] much of u manager career growth do you
[00:36:10] see is uh situational and how much of it
[00:36:12] is something you can control uh as
[00:36:16] you're looking forward by making the
[00:36:17] right decisions. The more I progress in
[00:36:21] my career, the more I realize I cannot
[00:36:24] control too many things particular for
[00:36:26] manager positions because manager
[00:36:29] position by its nature is heavily
[00:36:31] constrained by organization structure
[00:36:33] and organization need. These are the
[00:36:35] things that relate to overall company
[00:36:37] strategies not related to yourself. So
[00:36:40] that's why like the only thing you can
[00:36:41] do is to do the best in the positions
[00:36:46] that you have and then everything else
[00:36:48] will be a lagging indicators. And the
[00:36:50] one things that I also realized is that
[00:36:52] the happiest time in my career is that
[00:36:55] when I start to realize this is that
[00:36:57] don't don't aim for promotions. Don't
[00:37:00] make promotions to be the objective of
[00:37:04] your work. If you start to do that,
[00:37:06] you're going to feel really painful
[00:37:08] because there's one exercise I sometimes
[00:37:10] see from the people I I I mentor is that
[00:37:14] they will just like look at every single
[00:37:16] bullet points of the next level. They
[00:37:18] start to check, okay, do I meet this? Do
[00:37:20] I do? Oh, okay. I meet everything. Now
[00:37:22] that I'm talking to managers, okay, when
[00:37:24] can I get next promotions? That's very
[00:37:27] wrong. Don't do that. Because when you
[00:37:29] start to get into that mindset, you
[00:37:31] start to counting your your happiness or
[00:37:35] your career growth towards some things
[00:37:36] that you don't have fully full control
[00:37:38] on. In fact, you think about things
[00:37:40] reversely. Control the things that you
[00:37:42] can control, which is making impact for
[00:37:45] your current positions and drive your
[00:37:47] career towards a positions that you love
[00:37:50] in the long terms and don't make
[00:37:53] yourself feel regrettable at that time.
[00:37:55] That's the things you can control.
[00:37:57] controlled it. Everything else will be a
[00:37:59] lagging indicators. If you're lucky, you
[00:38:01] get the promotions. If you're not lucky,
[00:38:04] don't worry about it. Sometime something
[00:38:05] will come afterwards. You can even found
[00:38:07] your own company at some points and you
[00:38:09] may be even richer at that time. Always
[00:38:12] focus on things that you can control. I
[00:38:14] think that's the that's how you can
[00:38:17] become happier in your career. I think
[00:38:19] and then the last question I'd like to
[00:38:21] ask is um if you could give yourself
[00:38:23] some advice right when you had graduated
[00:38:25] from the PhD program knowing everything
[00:38:28] you know in your career what advice
[00:38:30] would you give yourself?
[00:38:32] >> You don't need to always follow the cal
[00:38:34] conventional wisdom and everyone is
[00:38:37] unique and everyone can choose the past
[00:38:41] they want. As another anecdotal example
[00:38:45] like before I choose CMU as a school I
[00:38:48] actually have a few other offers like
[00:38:50] Princeton or Cornell and those school
[00:38:51] and my dad later asked me okay why you
[00:38:54] are not going to Princeton because
[00:38:57] Princeton is like much more well-known
[00:38:59] school back in China I did not listen to
[00:39:01] his advice and I think it's the right
[00:39:02] call because CMU is much better places
[00:39:05] for computer science but that's a
[00:39:07] conventional wisdom so you don't need to
[00:39:09] always follow and as another example I
[00:39:12] And I sort of mentioned that a little
[00:39:14] bit is that there's almost no one in the
[00:39:17] research community will consider joining
[00:39:20] a small company like Facebook like fair
[00:39:22] was created back in like 2014 but 2009
[00:39:26] five years earlier it's very difficult
[00:39:28] for a researchers to completely reset
[00:39:32] like his research career and join a
[00:39:35] software engineering company like that.
[00:39:38] But I don't think that will apply to me.
[00:39:39] I would just want to try something new
[00:39:41] and once I know what's a northstar that
[00:39:43] I'm aiming for then I'm going to apply
[00:39:47] the strategies behind that and go
[00:39:49] towards it. I think this will be a more
[00:39:52] difficult path to be honest. It's like
[00:39:54] less comfortable.
[00:39:56] But I also believe that only the people
[00:39:58] who can think differently early they can
[00:40:01] see the new opportunity that no one else
[00:40:03] can see. That will increase your chance
[00:40:05] to win the game at the end. Well, thank
[00:40:08] you so much, Rome, for your time. Um,
[00:40:10] really appreciate you sharing your
[00:40:12] career story with everyone. And now, if
[00:40:14] you want, um, maybe you could talk about
[00:40:16] Hey Jen and why it's a good place to
[00:40:19] work. I think there's a lot of, um,
[00:40:21] software engineers in the audience that
[00:40:23] might be interested.
[00:40:24] >> Totally. Yeah. So, Hen is um, allin-one
[00:40:28] video generation platforms. Our idea is
[00:40:30] very simple. We want everyone can be
[00:40:35] able to access to video generation and
[00:40:37] visual storytellings. We have a I would
[00:40:40] consider as the top tier technical stack
[00:40:43] on human centric video generations and
[00:40:46] we can build the best hyperrealistic
[00:40:48] avatar for people and compared with many
[00:40:51] other video generation platforms we are
[00:40:54] really differentiating on quality
[00:40:56] consistency and controllability and also
[00:40:59] another thing is that most of the other
[00:41:02] people want to focus on creative
[00:41:04] professional like movie makers Hollywood
[00:41:07] stuff We really want to focus on content
[00:41:10] professionals like marketers,
[00:41:12] salespersons and everyday corporate
[00:41:14] persons like us. We really want to
[00:41:16] enable not just the Hollywood people can
[00:41:19] make video. We want to enable everyone
[00:41:22] to make videos at any source at any
[00:41:25] languages at all times. So my dream is
[00:41:28] very simple. I want to make camera
[00:41:30] obsolete. I want to make the
[00:41:32] storytelling accessible to everyone
[00:41:35] without a camera. So that's what we are
[00:41:37] hoping for.
[00:41:37] >> Yeah. Maybe one day I won't need to be
[00:41:40] in front of the camera for the podcast.
[00:41:41] I can just give a script to one of your
[00:41:44] models.
[00:41:45] >> I'm literally thinking about same
[00:41:46] things. Maybe in the future we just have
[00:41:48] two literally interactive avatar talking
[00:41:50] to each other. We can finish our podcast
[00:41:52] in that way.
[00:41:53] >> Thanks for listening to the podcast. I
[00:41:55] don't sell anything or do sponsorships,
[00:41:58] but if you want to help out with the
[00:42:00] podcast, you can support by engaging
[00:42:03] with the content on YouTube or on
[00:42:05] Spotify. If you want to drop a review,
[00:42:07] that'll be super helpful. And if there's
[00:42:09] any guests that you want to bring on to,
[00:42:11] please let me know. I feel like sourcing
[00:42:14] very senior IC's, there's no wellstudied
[00:42:18] list out there on Google that I can just
[00:42:19] search this up. So, if there's someone
[00:42:21] in your org or at your company who you
[00:42:23] really look up to and you want to hear
[00:42:24] their career story, let me know and I'll
[00:42:27] reach out to
