You are an expert podcast script writer.
Convert the following article summary into a refined, engaging dialogue between two podcast hosts, Alex (Male) and Jamie (Female).
They should sound professional but conversational, like "The Daily" or tech podcasts.
Keep it under 3 minutes (about 400-500 words).

Format the output strictly as XML:

<podcast>
 <line speaker="Alex">Hello and welcome back to Denoise.</line>
 <line speaker="Jamie">Today we are discussing something fascinating...</line>
 ...
</podcast>

Do not output standard markdown. Only output valid XML.
